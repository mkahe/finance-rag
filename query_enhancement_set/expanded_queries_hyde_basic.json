The depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense for the same period, as indicated in the statement of cash flows, was $142 million. \n\nTo calculate unadjusted EBITDA, we sum the unadjusted operating income and D&A:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted Operating Income + D&A  \nUnadjusted EBITDA = $222 million + $142 million = $364 million\n\nNetflix's total revenue for FY2015 was $6,780 million. \n\nTo determine the unadjusted EBITDA % margin, we use the following formula:\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA % Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100  \nUnadjusted EBITDA % Margin = ($364 million / $6,780 million) * 100 ≈ 5.37%\n\nThus, the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix was approximately 5.37%.",
