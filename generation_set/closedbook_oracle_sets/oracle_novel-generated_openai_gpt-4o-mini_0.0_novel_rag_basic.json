The total company organic sales change is 1.2%. \n\nLooking at the segments:\n- Safety and Industrial: Organic sales change is 1.0%.\n- Transportation and Electronics: Organic sales change is 1.2%.\n- Health Care: Organic sales change is 3.2%.\n- Consumer: Organic sales change is -0.9%.\n\nThe Consumer segment shows a negative organic sales change of -0.9%, indicating that it has not only failed to contribute positively to growth but has actually detracted from it. This negative performance in the Consumer segment is significant enough to impact the overall growth of the company, especially when the total organic sales change is only 1.2%.

      "answer": "Yes, not only they distribute the dividends on a routine basis, 3M has also been increasing the per share dividend for consecutive 65 years",
      "reasoning": "The evidence states that 3M has increased its dividends for 65 consecutive years. This indicates a long-term commitment to returning value to shareholders through regular dividend payments. A stable trend in dividend distribution is characterized by consistent increases or at least maintenance of dividend payouts over time. The fact that 3M has managed to increase its dividends annually for such an extended period suggests a strong and stable financial position, allowing the company to sustain and grow its dividend payments. Therefore, the evidence supports the conclusion that 3M maintains a stable trend of dividend distribution.",

This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\n(0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6 \n34.7 \n111.9 \n85.0 \n27.9 \n57.1 \nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7 \n5.5 \n0.2 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n0.3 \nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n"

      "answer": "Yes, the FCF conversion (using net income as the denominator) for Adobe has improved by ~13% from 143% in 2021 to 156% in 2022",
      "reasoning": "To determine if Adobe has an improving Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion as of FY2022, we first need to calculate the Free Cash Flow for the years provided. Free Cash Flow is typically calculated as Net Cash from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures (CapEx). \n\n1. **Net Cash from Operating Activities (FY2022)**: $7,838 million \n2. **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**: This can be inferred from the 'Purchases of property and equipment' line, which is $442 million for FY2022. \n\n3. **Free Cash Flow Calculation for FY2022**: \n   FCF = Net Cash from Operating Activities - CapEx \n   FCF = $7,838 million - $442 million = $7,396 million \n\nNext, we will calculate the Free Cash Flow for the previous years to analyze the trend:\n\n- **FY2021**: \n   Net Cash from Operating Activities = $7,230 million \n   CapEx = $348 million \n   FCF = $7,230 million - $348 million = $6,882 million \n\n- **FY2020**: \n   Net Cash from Operating Activities = $5,727 million \n   CapEx = $419 million \n   FCF = $5,727 million - $419 million = $5,308 million \n\nNow, we can summarize the Free Cash Flow for the three years:\n- FY2020: $5,308 million \n- FY2021: $6,882 million \n- FY2022: $7,396 million \n\nFrom this data, we can see that Free Cash Flow has increased each year:\n- From FY2020 to FY2021, FCF increased by $1,574 million.\n- From FY2021 to FY2022, FCF increased by $514 million.\n\nThis consistent increase in Free Cash Flow indicates that Adobe is improving its cash flow conversion over the years, as it is generating more cash from its operations relative to its capital expenditures. Therefore, we can conclude that Adobe has an improving Free Cash Flow conversion as of FY2022.",

      "reasoning": "To understand the nature and purpose of AMCOR's restructuring liability as of Q2 of FY2023, we need to analyze the provided financial data. The restructuring costs are typically associated with significant changes in a company's operations, such as layoffs, facility closures, or other strategic shifts aimed at improving efficiency or reducing costs. \n\nFrom the evidence, we see the following:\n- The liability balance at June 30, 2022, was $118 million, which included employee costs, fixed asset-related costs, and other costs.\n- Throughout the second half of 2022, AMCOR incurred net charges to earnings of $2 million, paid out $25 million in cash, and reversed $2 million of unused amounts, leading to a reduced liability balance of $93 million by December 31, 2022.\n- The breakdown of the liability at the end of 2022 shows that employee costs accounted for $81 million, fixed asset-related costs for $2 million, and other costs for $10 million.\n\nThis indicates that AMCOR's restructuring liability primarily relates to employee-related costs, likely due to workforce reductions or severance payments, as well as some costs associated with fixed assets and other operational adjustments. The purpose of this restructuring is likely to streamline operations and reduce ongoing costs, which is a common strategy for companies facing market pressures or aiming to enhance profitability. \n\nAs of Q2 FY2023, the restructuring liability reflects AMCOR's ongoing commitment to manage its operational costs effectively while transitioning through this restructuring phase.",

      "answer": "The Real Growth was flat in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.",
      "reasoning": "To determine the real change in sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange (FX) movements, passthrough costs, and one-off items, we need to focus on the Comparable Constant Currency Growth percentages provided in the evidence. \n\n1. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Comparable Constant Currency Growth for total sales is reported as (5%). This indicates a decrease in sales when adjusted for currency fluctuations and other factors. \n\n2. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Comparable Constant Currency Growth for total sales is reported as 1%. This indicates a slight increase in sales when adjusted for the same factors. \n\n3. To find the real change in sales, we can analyze the total net sales figures: \n   - FY 2022 total net sales: $14,544 million \n   - FY 2023 total net sales: $14,694 million \n   - The nominal change in sales is $14,694 million - $14,544 million = $150 million. \n\n4. However, we need to adjust this nominal change by the Comparable Constant Currency Growth rate for FY 2023, which is 1%. This means that the real change in sales, after accounting for the growth rate, is effectively a 1% increase on the previous year's sales. \n\n5. Therefore, the real change in sales, when considering the nominal increase and the growth rate, indicates that the sales have increased slightly in real terms, despite the nominal figures showing a larger increase. \n\nIn conclusion, the real change in sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022, after excluding FX, passthrough costs, and one-off items, is a slight increase of 1%.",

This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result,\nwe report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K).\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally.

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\ndirectly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\ncustomers.\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\nCompetition in Client Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms.

Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n42\n"

This growth has \nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n \nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \nexpense.\n \nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \n \nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n \nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \n \nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\n \nInternational Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$\n 693 \n $\n 760 \n $\n 1,359 \n $\n 1,513 \nRevenue % change\n \n (8.8)% \n (9.3)% \n (10.2)% \n (7.4)%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (5.4)% \n (4.2)% \n (5.5)% \n (2.8)%\nGross profit\n$\n 168 \n $\n 178 \n $\n 326 \n $\n 361 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 24.2 % \n 23.4 % \n 24.0 % \n 23.9 %\nSG&A\n$\n 149 \n $\n 150 \n $\n 287 \n $\n 299 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n \n 21.5 % \n 19.7 % \n 21.1 % \n 19.8 %\nRestructuring charges\n$\n - \n $\n - \n $\n (1) \n $\n 1 \nOperating income\n$\n 19 \n $\n 28 \n $\n 40 \n $\n 61 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 2.7 % \n 3.7 % \n 2.9 % \n 4.0 %\n \nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \n \n18\n"

      "company": "Boeing",
      "answer": "Yes, Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry.",
      "reasoning": "The evidence indicates that the airline industry is cyclical and competitive, with significant profit swings and ongoing challenges related to cost competitiveness. Since Boeing is a major manufacturer of commercial aircraft, its business is closely tied to the health of the airline industry. When airlines experience downturns, such as during economic recessions or global events that reduce travel demand, they tend to cut back on aircraft orders, which directly impacts Boeing's sales and profitability. Conversely, during periods of economic growth, airlines may increase their orders, leading to higher revenues for Boeing. Therefore, Boeing's business is indeed subject to the cyclicality of the airline industry, as its performance is influenced by the economic cycles affecting its customers.",

Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\ncertification and production schedules.\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability.

For 2023, JnJ is guiding for an adjusted operational EPS of $10.50, which reflects a growth of 3.5%. This guidance indicates that while the growth rate is positive, it is not accelerating compared to the previous year's adjusted EPS growth of 3.6%.

In a liquidation scenario, shareholders would receive the TBVPS amount per share they own, assuming there are no other liabilities that would further reduce this value. Therefore, if JPM were to liquidate all its assets, each shareholder would receive $66.56 per share they hold, as this is the value attributed to their ownership based on the firm's tangible assets.",

In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's \ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening \nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels.

      "reasoning": "To determine if there were any potential events outside of Pfizer's standard business operations that substantially increased net income in 2019, we need to analyze the provided financial data. In 2019, Pfizer's net income attributable to common shareholders was $16,026 million. \n\nLooking at the income from continuing operations, which was $10,738 million, we can see that this figure is a more direct reflection of the company's core business performance. The difference between net income and income from continuing operations is significant, as it includes the impact of discontinued operations, which contributed $5,318 million to net income in 2019. This suggests that a substantial portion of the net income was derived from discontinued operations, which are not part of Pfizer's ongoing business activities. \n\nAdditionally, there were no extraordinary gains or losses reported in the 2019 data that would indicate a one-time event contributing to the net income. The other income and deductions net figure shows a gain of $3,497 million in 2019, but this is not detailed enough to ascertain if it was due to non-standard operations. \n\nOverall, the significant contribution from discontinued operations indicates that there were indeed events outside of Pfizer's standard business operations that substantially increased net income in 2019.",

Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.",

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n64\n"

In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in developmentindefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technologyfinite-lived licensing agreements\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market\nparticipant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for\nthe treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470\nmillion contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset.

In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\nbanking fees.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n65\n"

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

This reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to several factors: 1) Lower marketing expenses, which suggests that the company was able to maintain or grow sales without proportionately increasing its marketing spend. 2) Leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, meaning that as sales increased, the fixed costs associated with incentive compensation did not rise at the same rate, thus improving the efficiency of these expenses relative to sales. 3) The overall increase in net sales (18.3%) outpaced the increase in SG&A expenses (16.2%), leading to a lower ratio of SG&A to net sales. However, there were also offsetting factors such as strategic investments and increased store payroll and benefits due to wage investments, which contributed to the overall SG&A increase.

The evidence provided states that during fiscal 2022, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $900 million. However, it does not provide specific information about the total stock repurchases for FY 2023, as the data only covers the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. \n\nSince the question asks for FY 2023, we can infer that the repurchase activity in Q4 of FY 2022 (which is the last quarter of fiscal 2022) is part of the overall repurchase strategy leading into FY 2023. The total repurchase amount in Q4 of FY 2022 was $328.1 million. \n\nWithout additional data on the total repurchase amount for FY 2023, we cannot calculate the percentage of the total spend that occurred in Q4 of FY 2023. Therefore, we conclude that the information provided is insufficient to answer the question accurately. \n\nIf we assume that the total spend for FY 2023 is the same as FY 2022 ($900 million), then the calculation would be: (328.1 million / 900 million) * 100 = 36.56%. However, this is purely hypothetical and not based on actual FY 2023 data. \n\nThus, the final answer is that we cannot determine the percentage without knowing the total repurchase amount for FY 2023.",

This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales suggests that the company was able to manage its expenses relative to its sales growth. The evidence specifically mentions that the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was partially due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, but it also notes that there was deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. However, since the overall SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased, it implies that the increase in wages expense did not outpace the growth in net sales.
