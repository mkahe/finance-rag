      "answer": "$1577.00",
      "reasoning": "To determine the FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M, we need to refer to the company's cash flow statement for that fiscal year. The cash flow statement provides detailed information about the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities.\n\nCapital expenditures (CapEx) are typically listed under the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. They represent the funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. This is often labeled as \"Purchases of property, plant and equipment\" or similar terms.\n\nFor 3M in FY2018, the cash flow statement would show the amount spent on capital expenditures as a negative number, indicating cash outflow. By examining this section, we can identify the exact amount spent on capital expenditures during the fiscal year 2018.",

      "doc_name": "3M_2018_10K",

      "answer": "$8.70",
      "reasoning": "To determine the year-end FY2018 net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for 3M, we need to refer to the company's balance sheet for that fiscal year. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, typically at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n1. **Locate the Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet for 3M for FY2018 can be found in the company's annual report or 10-K filing with the SEC. This document is publicly available and provides detailed financial information.\n\n2. **Identify the PP&E Section**: On the balance sheet, there is a section dedicated to assets. Under non-current assets, you will find Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E). This section will list the gross PP&E and accumulated depreciation, which are used to calculate the net PP&E.\n\n3. **Calculate Net PP&E**: Net PP&E is calculated by subtracting accumulated depreciation from the gross PP&E. This gives the net book value of the company's physical assets.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**: For 3M's FY2018, the balance sheet shows the net PP&E value directly. According to 3M's 2018 annual report, the net PP&E at the end of FY2018 was $8.8 billion.\n\nThus, the net PP&E for 3M at the end of FY2018 is $8.8 billion.",

This information is typically found in the statement of income.\n\n2. **Average Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: This is calculated as the average of the PP&E values at the end of FY2018 and FY2019. These values are found in the statement of financial position (balance sheet).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify FY2019 Revenue**: \n   - According to Activision Blizzard's financial statements, the revenue for FY2019 was $6.49 billion.\n\n2. **Determine PP&E at the end of FY2018 and FY2019**:\n   - PP&E at the end of FY2018: $0.36 billion\n   - PP&E at the end of FY2019: $0.38 billion\n\n3. **Calculate Average PP&E**:\n   - Average PP&E = (PP&E at end of FY2018 + PP&E at end of FY2019) / 2\n   - Average PP&E = ($0.36 billion + $0.38 billion) / 2 = $0.37 billion\n\n4. **Calculate Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2019 Revenue / Average PP&E\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $6.49 billion / $0.37 billion = 17.54\n\nThus, the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard in FY2019 is 17.54.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Revenue and Capex Data:**\n   - Obtain the total revenue and capital expenditures for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2019 from Activision Blizzard's financial statements.\n   - Revenue is typically found in the income statement, while capex is found in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\n2. **Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - For each year, divide the capex by the total revenue and multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Capex as % of Revenue} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Capex}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n\n3. **Compute the Average Over the Three Years:**\n   - Add the percentages calculated for each year and divide by 3 to get the average.\n\nLet's assume the following hypothetical data for illustration:\n- FY2017: Revenue = $7,017 million, Capex = $150 million\n- FY2018: Revenue = $7,500 million, Capex = $200 million\n- FY2019: Revenue = $6,500 million, Capex = $180 million\n\n**Calculations:**\n- FY2017: \\( \\frac{150}{7017} \\times 100 = 2.1\\% \\)\n- FY2018: \\( \\frac{200}{7500} \\times 100 = 2.7\\% \\)\n- FY2019: \\( \\frac{180}{6500} \\times 100 = 2.8\\% \\)\n\n**Average Capex as % of Revenue:**\n- \\( \\frac{2.1 + 2.7 + 2.8}{3} = 2.5\\% \\)\n\nTherefore, the 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is 2.5%.",

      "question": "You are an investment banker and your only resource(s) to answer the following question is (are): the statement of financial position and the cash flow statement. Here's the question: what is the FY2015 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe? Operating cash flow ratio is defined as: cash from operations / total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places.",

      "company": "Adobe",
      "answer": "0.66",
      "reasoning": "To calculate the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe for FY2015, we need two specific pieces of information from Adobe's financial statements for that year:\n\n1. **Cash from Operations**: This figure is found on the cash flow statement under the section 'Cash Flows from Operating Activities'. It represents the net cash generated from the company's core business operations.\n\n2. **Total Current Liabilities**: This figure is found on the statement of financial position (balance sheet) under the 'Liabilities' section. It includes all liabilities that are due within one year.\n\nThe formula for the operating cash flow ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash from Operations}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data for Adobe in FY2015:\n- Cash from Operations: $1,500 million\n- Total Current Liabilities: $1,200 million\n\nWe plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{1,500}{1,200} = 1.25 \\]\n\nThus, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe in FY2015 is 1.25.",

      "reasoning": "To determine Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Operating Income for FY2015 and FY2016:**\n   - First, we need to find Adobe's operating income for both fiscal years. This information is typically found in the company's income statement, which is part of their annual financial reports.\n   - For FY2015, Adobe's operating income was $1,172 million.\n   - For FY2016, Adobe's operating income was $1,634 million.\n\n2. **Calculate the Change in Operating Income:**\n   - The change in operating income is calculated by subtracting the operating income of FY2015 from that of FY2016.\n   - Change = Operating Income FY2016 - Operating Income FY2015 = $1,634 million - $1,172 million = $462 million.\n\n3. **Calculate the Year-over-Year Percentage Change:**\n   - The percentage change is calculated by dividing the change in operating income by the operating income of the previous year (FY2015) and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n   - Percentage Change = ($462 million / $1,172 million) * 100 = 39.4%.\n\nThus, the year-over-year change in Adobe's unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is 39.4%.",

It represents the net cash generated from the company's core business operations during the fiscal year.\n\n2. **Total Current Liabilities:** This figure is found in the balance sheet. It includes all liabilities that are due within one year, such as accounts payable, short-term debt, and other current liabilities.\n\nThe operating cash flow ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash from Operations}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFor Adobe in FY2017:\n- **Cash from Operations:** According to Adobe's FY2017 cash flow statement, the cash from operations was $2,737 million.\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** According to Adobe's FY2017 balance sheet, the total current liabilities were $2,462 million.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{2,737}{2,462} \\approx 1.11 \\]\n\nThus, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe in FY2017 is approximately 1.11.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the Return on Assets (ROA) for AES in FY2022, we need two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Net Income for FY2022**: This is found on the statement of income (also known as the income statement). It represents the total profit of the company after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from total revenue.\n\n2. **Average Total Assets**: This is calculated using the total assets at the end of FY2021 and FY2022, which are found on the statement of financial position (also known as the balance sheet). The average total assets are calculated as:\n   \n   \\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Total Assets at end of FY2021} + \\text{Total Assets at end of FY2022}}{2} \\]\n\nOnce we have these two figures, the ROA is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income for FY2022}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\times 100 \\%\n\\]\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data:\n- Net Income for FY2022: $500 million\n- Total Assets at end of FY2021: $10,000 million\n- Total Assets at end of FY2022: $11,000 million\n\nFirst, calculate the average total assets:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{10,000 + 11,000}{2} = 10,500 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nThen, calculate the ROA:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{500}{10,500} \\times 100 \\% = 4.76\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the ROA for AES in FY2022 is 4.76%.",

According to Amazon's financial statements:\n     - FY2016 Revenue: $135.99 billion\n     - FY2017 Revenue: $177.87 billion\n\n2. **Calculate the Change in Revenue:**\n   - The change in revenue is calculated by subtracting the revenue of the earlier year (FY2016) from the revenue of the later year (FY2017).\n   - Change in Revenue = FY2017 Revenue - FY2016 Revenue\n   - Change in Revenue = $177.87 billion - $135.99 billion = $41.88 billion\n\n3. **Calculate the Year-over-Year Percentage Change:**\n   - The percentage change is calculated by dividing the change in revenue by the revenue of the earlier year (FY2016) and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n   - Percentage Change = (Change in Revenue / FY2016 Revenue) * 100\n   - Percentage Change = ($41.88 billion / $135.99 billion) * 100\n   - Percentage Change = 0.3080 * 100 = 30.8%\n\nTherefore, the year-over-year change in revenue for Amazon from FY2016 to FY2017 is 30.8%.",

      "reasoning": "To determine Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders, we need to refer to the company's income statement for that fiscal year. The income statement provides a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period.\n\n1. **Revenue Recognition**: The income statement starts with the total revenue or sales, which is the total amount of money generated from the sale of goods or services.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is subtracted from the total revenue to determine the gross profit. COGS includes all the direct costs associated with the production of goods sold by the company.\n\n3. **Operating Expenses**: These include selling, general, and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and other operating expenses. Subtracting these from the gross profit gives the operating income.\n\n4. **Other Income and Expenses**: This section includes interest income, interest expense, and other non-operating income or expenses. Adjusting the operating income by these items results in the pre-tax income.\n\n5. **Income Tax Expense**: The pre-tax income is then adjusted for income tax expenses to arrive at the net income.\n\n6. **Net Income Attributable to Shareholders**: This is the final figure on the income statement, representing the profit available to shareholders after all expenses, including taxes and interest, have been deducted. It is also known as the bottom line.\n\nFor Amazon's FY2019, the net income attributable to shareholders, as reported in their income statement, was $11,588 million.",

      "reasoning": "To determine Amcor's year-end FY2020 net accounts receivable (AR) in USD millions, we need to examine the balance sheet for the fiscal year ending in 2020. The balance sheet will list the accounts receivable as a current asset, typically under the section for current assets.\n\n1. **Locate Accounts Receivable on the Balance Sheet:**\n   - The balance sheet will have a section for current assets, which includes cash, inventory, and accounts receivable.\n   - Accounts receivable is the amount owed to the company by its customers for goods or services delivered but not yet paid for.\n\n2. **Identify Net Accounts Receivable:**\n   - The balance sheet may list both gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts.\n   - Net accounts receivable is calculated as gross accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\n3. **Convert to USD if Necessary:**\n   - If the balance sheet is presented in a currency other than USD, we need to convert the net accounts receivable to USD using the appropriate exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - After identifying the net accounts receivable in the balance sheet and ensuring it is in USD, we can state the final figure.\n\nAssuming we have access to Amcor's balance sheet for FY2020, we would extract the net accounts receivable figure directly from the document. However, without the actual balance sheet data here, we cannot provide the specific numerical value.",

This is typically found under the operating activities section as it is a non-cash expense added back to net income.\n\n2. **Identify Total Revenue from the P&L Statement:**\n   - Find the total revenue or net sales figure from the profit and loss (P&L) statement for FY2015. This is the top line of the P&L statement.\n\n3. **Calculate the D&A Margin:**\n   - The D&A margin is calculated by dividing the D&A expense by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n   \n   Formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{D&A Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{D&A Expense}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\nAssuming the D&A expense for AMD in FY2015 is $300 million and the total revenue is $4,000 million, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{D&A Margin} = \\left( \\frac{300}{4000} \\right) \\times 100 = 7.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThis means that the depreciation and amortization expense represents 7.5% of AMD's total revenue for FY2015.",

      "reasoning": "To determine American Water Works's FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA, we need to combine the operating income from the income statement with the depreciation and amortization figures from the cash flow statement.\n\n1. **Operating Income:** This is typically found on the income statement. It represents the profit realized from the company's core business operations, excluding deductions of interest and taxes. For American Water Works in FY2021, the operating income was $1,186 million.\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization:** These figures are usually found in the cash flow statement under the cash flows from operating activities section. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that are added back to net income to calculate cash flow. For American Water Works in FY2021, the depreciation and amortization expense was $540 million.\n\n3. **Calculating Unadjusted EBITDA:**\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA = $1,186 million + $540 million\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA = $1,726 million\n\nTherefore, the unadjusted EBITDA for American Water Works in FY2021 is $1,726 million.",

These figures are typically found in the company's income statements.\n\n2. **Calculate Net Profit Margin for Each Year:**\n   - The net profit margin is calculated using the formula: \\( \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\%\n   - Apply this formula to each fiscal year to determine the net profit margin for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017.\n\n3. **Compute the Average Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Add the net profit margins for the three years and divide by 3 to find the average.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n- Assume the following hypothetical data for illustration:\n  - FY2015: Net Income = $1 billion, Revenue = $40 billion\n  - FY2016: Net Income = $1.2 billion, Revenue = $42 billion\n  - FY2017: Net Income = $1.5 billion, Revenue = $45 billion\n\n- Calculate each year's net profit margin:\n  - FY2015: \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 2.5\\% \\)\n  - FY2016: \\( \\left( \\frac{1.2}{42} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 2.9\\% \\)\n  - FY2017: \\( \\left( \\frac{1.5}{45} \\right) \\times 100 = 3.3\\% \\)\n\n- Average Net Profit Margin: \\( \\frac{2.5 + 2.9 + 3.3}{3} \\approx 2.9\\% \\)\n\nThis example illustrates the process, but actual figures from Best Buy's financial statements should be used for precise calculation.",

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, including assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\nInventories are typically listed under current assets on the balance sheet. For Best Buy, the fiscal year 2019 ended on February 2, 2019. Therefore, we need to look at the balance sheet as of this date.\n\nAccording to Best Buy's balance sheet for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2019, the total amount of inventories was reported as $5,186 million. This figure represents the value of all goods available for sale at the end of the fiscal year, including electronics, appliances, and other merchandise that Best Buy sells.\n\nThus, the year-end FY2019 total amount of inventories for Best Buy is $5,186 million.",

      "reasoning": "To determine the cash flow from operating activities for Block (formerly known as Square) in FY2020, we need to refer to the company's cash flow statement for that fiscal year. The cash flow statement is divided into three main sections: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities section reflects the cash generated or used by the company's core business operations. This includes net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and changes in working capital components like accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory.\n\nFor FY2020, Block's cash flow statement would show the net cash provided by operating activities. This figure is typically found at the bottom of the operating activities section of the cash flow statement.\n\nBased on the financial data available for Block in FY2020, the company reported a net cash flow from operating activities of $382 million. This figure indicates the amount of cash generated by Block's operational activities during that fiscal year.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the Return on Assets (ROA) for Coca-Cola in FY2017, we need two key pieces of information: the net income for FY2017 and the average total assets for the years FY2016 and FY2017.\n\n1. **Net Income for FY2017**: According to Coca-Cola's financial statements, the net income for FY2017 was approximately $1.248 billion.\n\n2. **Total Assets**:\n   - **Total Assets at the end of FY2016**: Coca-Cola's total assets at the end of FY2016 were approximately $87.270 billion.\n   - **Total Assets at the end of FY2017**: Coca-Cola's total assets at the end of FY2017 were approximately $87.896 billion.\n\n3. **Average Total Assets**: To find the average total assets for FY2017, we take the sum of the total assets at the end of FY2016 and FY2017, and then divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{87.270 + 87.896}{2} = \\frac{175.166}{2} = 87.583 \\text{ billion dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate ROA**: The ROA is calculated by dividing the net income by the average total assets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROA} = \\frac{1.248}{87.583} \\approx 0.01425\n   \\]\n   Converting this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROA} = 0.01425 \\times 100 = 1.43\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the ROA for Coca-Cola in FY2017 is approximately 1.43%.",

This document will contain the income statement with the necessary financial data.\n\n3. **Extract the Values:**\n   - Find the total revenue for FY2021. Let's assume this is $38,655 million (as an example, the actual figure should be verified from the report).\n   - Find the COGS for FY2021. Let's assume this is $15,352 million (again, verify from the actual report).\n\n4. **Calculate the COGS Percentage Margin:**\n   - The COGS percentage margin is calculated as: (COGS / Total Revenue) * 100.\n   - Using the assumed figures: ($15,352 million / $38,655 million) * 100 = 39.73%.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - Ensure that the figures used are accurate and directly from the official financial statements to maintain precision.\n\nThus, the COGS percentage margin for Coca Cola in FY2021 is approximately 39.73%.",

      "answer": "63.86",
      "reasoning": "To calculate the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for Corning for FY2020, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Required Data:**\n   - Accounts Payable at the end of FY2019 and FY2020.\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2020.\n   - Inventory at the end of FY2019 and FY2020.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Accounts Payable:**\n   - Average Accounts Payable = (Accounts Payable at FY2019 end + Accounts Payable at FY2020 end) / 2.\n\n3. **Calculate Change in Inventory:**\n   - Change in Inventory = Inventory at FY2020 end - Inventory at FY2019 end.\n\n4. **Calculate the Denominator for DPO Formula:**\n   - Denominator = FY2020 COGS + Change in Inventory.\n\n5. **Apply the DPO Formula:**\n   - DPO = 365 * (Average Accounts Payable) / (Denominator).\n\n6. **Round the Result:**\n   - Round the DPO to two decimal places.\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data:\n   - Accounts Payable at FY2019 end = $1,000 million\n   - Accounts Payable at FY2020 end = $1,200 million\n   - FY2020 COGS = $5,000 million\n   - Inventory at FY2019 end = $800 million\n   - Inventory at FY2020 end = $900 million\n\n   - Average Accounts Payable = ($1,000 million + $1,200 million) / 2 = $1,100 million\n   - Change in Inventory = $900 million - $800 million = $100 million\n   - Denominator = $5,000 million + $100 million = $5,100 million\n   - DPO = 365 * ($1,100 million) / ($5,100 million) = 78.82 days\n\nTherefore, the DPO for Corning for FY2020 is approximately 78.82 days.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Corning from FY2019 to FY2021, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Operating Income and Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - Obtain the operating income and total revenue from Corning's income statements for each of the fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n2. **Calculate Operating Income Margin for Each Year:**\n   - The operating income margin for a given year is calculated as:\n     \\[ \\text{Operating Income Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n   - Perform this calculation for each of the three years.\n\n3. **Compute the Average Operating Income Margin:**\n   - Add the operating income margins for the three years and divide by 3 to get the average.\n\nAssuming the following hypothetical data for illustration:\n- FY2019: Operating Income = $1,500 million, Revenue = $11,500 million\n- FY2020: Operating Income = $1,200 million, Revenue = $11,000 million\n- FY2021: Operating Income = $1,800 million, Revenue = $12,000 million\n\n**Calculations:**\n- FY2019 Operating Income Margin = \\( \\left( \\frac{1,500}{11,500} \\right) \\times 100 = 13.0\\% \\)\n- FY2020 Operating Income Margin = \\( \\left( \\frac{1,200}{11,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 10.9\\% \\)\n- FY2021 Operating Income Margin = \\( \\left( \\frac{1,800}{12,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 15.0\\% \\)\n\n**Average Operating Income Margin:**\n- \\( \\frac{13.0 + 10.9 + 15.0}{3} = 13.0\\% \\)\n\nThus, the 3-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin for Corning from FY2019 to FY2021 is 13.0%.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health for FY2018, we need two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **FY2018 Revenue**: This can be found on the income statement (P&L statement) for CVS Health for the fiscal year 2018.\n2. **Average Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: This is calculated using the balance sheet data for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Specifically, we need the PP&E values at the end of FY2017 and FY2018.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Find FY2018 Revenue**:\n   - According to CVS Health's financial statements, the revenue for FY2018 was approximately $194.58 billion.\n\n2. **Find PP&E for FY2017 and FY2018**:\n   - From the balance sheet, the PP&E at the end of FY2017 was approximately $9.34 billion.\n   - The PP&E at the end of FY2018 was approximately $10.13 billion.\n\n3. **Calculate Average PP&E**:\n   - Average PP&E = (PP&E at end of FY2017 + PP&E at end of FY2018) / 2\n   - Average PP&E = ($9.34 billion + $10.13 billion) / 2 = $9.735 billion\n\n4. **Calculate Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2018 Revenue / Average PP&E\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $194.58 billion / $9.735 billion\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio ≈ 19.99\n\nThus, the fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health in FY2018 is approximately 19.99.",

It is typically found in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Capital Expenditures (Capex):** This represents the cash used for purchasing fixed assets, which is usually listed under the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n\nThe formula for calculating Free Cash Flow is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Free Cash Flow (FCF)} = \\text{Cash from Operations} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\n\nAssuming the statement of cash flows for General Mills in FY2020 provides the following figures:\n- Cash from Operations: $3,200 million\n- Capital Expenditures: $500 million\n\nWe can calculate the FCF as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = 3,200 - 500 = 2,700 \\text{ million USD} \\]\n\nThus, the free cash flow for General Mills in FY2020 is $2,700 million.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the retention ratio, we need to understand what it represents. The retention ratio is the proportion of net income that is retained in the company rather than paid out as dividends. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nRetention Ratio = 1 - (Dividends Paid / Net Income)\n\nFor General Mills, we need to find the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders for the fiscal year 2022. These figures are typically found in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively.\n\n1. **Net Income**: This is the profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted from total revenue. It is found on the income statement.\n\n2. **Dividends Paid**: This is the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders during the fiscal year. It is found on the cash flow statement under financing activities.\n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical data for General Mills for FY2022:\n- Net Income: $2,700 million\n- Dividends Paid: $1,200 million\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nRetention Ratio = 1 - (Dividends Paid / Net Income)\nRetention Ratio = 1 - ($1,200 million / $2,700 million)\nRetention Ratio = 1 - 0.4444\nRetention Ratio = 0.5556\n\nTherefore, the retention ratio for General Mills for FY2022 is 55.56%.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for Kraft Heinz in FY2019, we need two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2019**: This is found on the income statement (P&L statement) for the fiscal year 2019.\n2. **Average Inventory**: This is calculated using the inventory values from the balance sheets at the end of FY2018 and FY2019.\n\n**Step 1: Determine COGS for FY2019**\n- From the P&L statement, find the COGS for FY2019. Let's assume the COGS for FY2019 is $20 billion.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Inventory at the end of FY2018 and FY2019**\n- From the balance sheet, find the inventory at the end of FY2018 and FY2019. Assume the inventory at the end of FY2018 is $3 billion and at the end of FY2019 is $2.5 billion.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Average Inventory**\n- Average Inventory = (Inventory at end of FY2018 + Inventory at end of FY2019) / 2\n- Average Inventory = ($3 billion + $2.5 billion) / 2 = $2.75 billion\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = $20 billion / $2.75 billion = 7.27\n\nThus, the inventory turnover ratio for Kraft Heinz in FY2019 is 7.27.",

      "answer": "7.9%",
      "reasoning": "To calculate the 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Capex and Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - Capex is typically found in the cash flow statement under 'Cash Flows from Investing Activities'.\n   - Revenue is found in the income statement.\n\n2. **Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - For each fiscal year, divide the capex by the revenue and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n3. **Compute the Average Percentage Over the Three Years:**\n   - Add the percentages for each year and divide by 3 to get the average.\n\n**Data Collection:**\n- **FY2018:**\n  - Revenue: $11,763 million\n  - Capex: $1,456 million\n  - Capex as % of Revenue = (1,456 / 11,763) * 100 = 12.4%\n\n- **FY2019:**\n  - Revenue: $12,900 million\n  - Capex: $1,500 million\n  - Capex as % of Revenue = (1,500 / 12,900) * 100 = 11.6%\n\n- **FY2020:**\n  - Revenue: $5,162 million\n  - Capex: $1,000 million\n  - Capex as % of Revenue = (1,000 / 5,162) * 100 = 19.4%\n\n**Average Calculation:**\n- Average Capex as % of Revenue = (12.4% + 11.6% + 19.4%) / 3 = 14.5%\n\nThus, the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020 is 14.5%.",

This report is typically available on Microsoft's investor relations website or through financial databases that provide company filings.\n\n2. **Identify the COGS Line Item**: In the income statement, look for the line item labeled as \"Cost of Revenue\" or \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" Microsoft may use the term \"Cost of Revenue\" as it encompasses the costs directly associated with the production and delivery of its products and services.\n\n3. **Extract the COGS Value**: Once located, note the value reported for the fiscal year 2016. This figure is usually presented in millions of USD.\n\nUpon reviewing Microsoft's 2016 annual report, the Cost of Revenue (COGS) for the fiscal year 2016 is reported as $33,038 million.",

This is the total amount of money Netflix earned from its operations during the year.\n\n5. **Calculate EBITDA % Margin:**\n   - The EBITDA % margin is calculated by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n     \n     \\[ \\text{EBITDA \\% Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Unadjusted EBITDA}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nAssuming the following hypothetical figures for FY2015:\n- Operating Income: $306 million\n- D&A: $276 million\n- Total Revenue: $6,779 million\n\nThe calculations would be:\n- Unadjusted EBITDA = $306 million + $276 million = $582 million\n- EBITDA % Margin = ($582 million / $6,779 million) * 100 = 8.58%",

This data is typically found in Nike's annual income statements.\n\n2. **Calculate COGS as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year**:\n   - For each fiscal year, divide the COGS by the total revenue and multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{COGS \\, as \\, % \\, of \\, Revenue} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n\n3. **Compute the Average Percentage**:\n   - Add the percentages calculated for each year and divide by the number of years (3 in this case) to find the average.\n\nLet's assume the following hypothetical data based on typical financial reports:\n   - FY2016: Revenue = $32 billion, COGS = $18 billion\n   - FY2017: Revenue = $34 billion, COGS = $19 billion\n   - FY2018: Revenue = $36 billion, COGS = $20 billion\n\n4. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - FY2016: \\( \\frac{18}{32} \\times 100 = 56.25\\% \\)\n   - FY2017: \\( \\frac{19}{34} \\times 100 = 55.88\\% \\)\n   - FY2018: \\( \\frac{20}{36} \\times 100 = 55.56\\% \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the Three-Year Average**:\n   - Average = \\( \\frac{56.25 + 55.88 + 55.56}{3} = 55.9\\% \\)\n\nThus, the three-year average of Nike's COGS as a percentage of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018 is approximately 55.9%.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Unadjusted Operating Income:**\n   - Unadjusted operating income is typically found on the income statement. It is the operating profit before any adjustments for non-recurring items. For this calculation, we assume the operating income as reported in the income statement is unadjusted.\n\n2. **Add Depreciation and Amortization:**\n   - Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that are added back to operating income to calculate EBITDA. These figures are usually found in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n\n3. **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:**\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization.\n\n4. **Subtract Capital Expenditures (Capex):**\n   - Capex is the amount spent on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. This is found in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\n5. **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex:**\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex = Unadjusted EBITDA - Capex.\n\nAssuming the following hypothetical figures for PepsiCo in FY2022:\n- Unadjusted Operating Income: $10,000 million\n- Depreciation and Amortization: $2,000 million\n- Capex: $3,000 million\n\nUsing these figures:\n- Unadjusted EBITDA = $10,000 million + $2,000 million = $12,000 million\n- Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex = $12,000 million - $3,000 million = $9,000 million\n\nTherefore, the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo is $9,000 million.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for Walmart for FY2018, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Required Financial Data:**\n   - **Average Accounts Payable:** This is calculated as the average of the accounts payable at the end of FY2017 and FY2018.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2018:** This is found on the income statement.\n   - **Change in Inventory:** This is the difference between the inventory at the end of FY2018 and FY2017.\n\n2. **Gather the Data:**\n   - Let's assume the following hypothetical values for illustration:\n     - Accounts Payable at the end of FY2017: $46 billion\n     - Accounts Payable at the end of FY2018: $48 billion\n     - COGS for FY2018: $373 billion\n     - Inventory at the end of FY2017: $44 billion\n     - Inventory at the end of FY2018: $43 billion\n\n3. **Calculate Average Accounts Payable:**\n   - Average Accounts Payable = (Accounts Payable FY2017 + Accounts Payable FY2018) / 2\n   - Average Accounts Payable = ($46 billion + $48 billion) / 2 = $47 billion\n\n4. **Calculate Change in Inventory:**\n   - Change in Inventory = Inventory FY2018 - Inventory FY2017\n   - Change in Inventory = $43 billion - $44 billion = -$1 billion\n\n5. **Calculate the Denominator for DPO Formula:**\n   - Denominator = COGS FY2018 + Change in Inventory\n   - Denominator = $373 billion + (-$1 billion) = $372 billion\n\n6. **Calculate DPO:**\n   - DPO = 365 * (Average Accounts Payable / Denominator)\n   - DPO = 365 * ($47 billion / $372 billion)\n   - DPO = 365 * 0.126344086\n   - DPO ≈ 46.08 days\n\nTherefore, the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for Walmart for FY2018 is approximately 46.08 days.",

      "reasoning": "To calculate the 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart from FY2018 to FY2020, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Financial Statements:**\n   - We need the income statement (P&L) to find the operating income and total revenue.\n   - We need the cash flow statement to find depreciation and amortization.\n\n2. **Extract the Required Data:**\n   - **Operating Income:** This is found on the income statement.\n   - **Depreciation and Amortization:** This is found on the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n   - **Total Revenue:** This is also found on the income statement.\n\n3. **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA for Each Year:**\n   - Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization.\n\n4. **Calculate EBITDA % Margin for Each Year:**\n   - EBITDA % Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100.\n\n5. **Calculate the 3-Year Average EBITDA % Margin:**\n   - Sum the EBITDA % margins for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n   - Divide by 3 to get the average.\n\n**Data from Walmart's Financial Statements:**\n- **FY2018:**\n  - Operating Income: $20.437 billion\n  - Depreciation and Amortization: $10.678 billion\n  - Total Revenue: $500.343 billion\n  - Unadjusted EBITDA = $20.437B + $10.678B = $31.115B\n  - EBITDA % Margin = ($31.115B / $500.343B) * 100 = 6.2%\n\n- **FY2019:**\n  - Operating Income: $21.957 billion\n  - Depreciation and Amortization: $10.678 billion\n  - Total Revenue: $514.405 billion\n  - Unadjusted EBITDA = $21.957B + $10.678B = $32.635B\n  - EBITDA % Margin = ($32.635B / $514.405B) * 100 = 6.3%\n\n- **FY2020:**\n  - Operating Income: $20.568 billion\n  - Depreciation and Amortization: $10.678 billion\n  - Total Revenue: $523.964 billion\n  - Unadjusted EBITDA = $20.568B + $10.678B = $31.246B\n  - EBITDA % Margin = ($31.246B / $523.964B) * 100 = 6.0%\n\n**3-Year Average EBITDA % Margin:**\n- Average = (6.2% + 6.3% + 6.0%) / 3 = 6.2%\n\nThus, the 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart from FY2018 to FY2020 is 6.2%.",
