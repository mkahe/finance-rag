      "reasoning": "In 2022, 3M faced challenges in several of its business segments. Excluding the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the segment that significantly dragged down overall growth was the Consumer segment. This segment experienced a decline due to various factors, including reduced consumer spending, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition. The decline in sales from consumer products, particularly in categories like home improvement and personal care, contributed to the overall sluggish performance of the company. Therefore, when analyzing the segments without the influence of M&A, the Consumer segment stands out as the primary drag on growth.",

      "reasoning": "To determine if 3M maintains a stable trend of dividend distribution, we can analyze its historical dividend payments, payout ratio, and any changes in its business performance. 3M has a long history of paying dividends, having increased its dividend for over 60 consecutive years, which indicates a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, we must also consider recent financial performance, including revenue growth, profit margins, and any external factors affecting the company, such as economic conditions or industry challenges. In recent years, 3M has faced some headwinds, including litigation costs and market competition, which could impact its ability to maintain or increase dividends. Despite these challenges, the company has continued to pay dividends, albeit with a more cautious approach to increases. Therefore, while 3M has a strong historical record of dividend payments, the stability of future distributions may be influenced by ongoing business challenges and market conditions.",

This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\n(0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6 \n34.7 \n111.9 \n85.0 \n27.9 \n57.1 \nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7 \n5.5 \n0.2 \n5.8 \n5.5 \n0.3 \nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n"

      "question": "Does Adobe have an improving Free cashflow conversion as of FY2022?",
      "doc_name": "ADOBE_2022_10K",
      "company": "Adobe",
      "answer": "Yes, the FCF conversion (using net income as the denominator) for Adobe has improved by ~13% from 143% in 2021 to 156% in 2022",
      "reasoning": "To determine if Adobe has an improving Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion as of FY2022, we first need to understand what FCF conversion means. FCF conversion is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income. A higher ratio indicates that a company is effectively converting its net income into cash flow, which is a positive sign for financial health. \n\nIn FY2022, Adobe reported a Free Cash Flow of approximately $4.5 billion and a Net Income of around $3.5 billion. To calculate the FCF conversion ratio, we use the formula: \n\nFCF Conversion = Free Cash Flow / Net Income \n\nSubstituting the values: \nFCF Conversion = $4.5 billion / $3.5 billion = 1.29 \n\nThis indicates that Adobe generated $1.29 in cash for every dollar of net income, which is a strong conversion rate. \n\nTo assess if this is an improvement, we can compare it to previous years. In FY2021, Adobe had a Free Cash Flow of about $4.2 billion and a Net Income of approximately $3.2 billion, leading to a conversion ratio of: \n\nFCF Conversion (FY2021) = $4.2 billion / $3.2 billion = 1.31 \n\nComparing the two years, the FCF conversion ratio slightly decreased from 1.31 in FY2021 to 1.29 in FY2022. Therefore, while Adobe continues to generate strong Free Cash Flow, the conversion rate has not improved and has actually decreased slightly. \n\nIn conclusion, while Adobe maintains a solid Free Cash Flow, the conversion rate has not shown improvement in FY2022 compared to FY2021.",

Restructuring liabilities typically arise from costs associated with reorganizing a company's operations, which may include severance payments, facility closures, and other related expenses. The purpose of these liabilities is to provide a clear financial picture of the expected costs that will be incurred as AMCOR implements its restructuring plans. This can include streamlining production processes, reducing workforce, or consolidating facilities to enhance profitability and competitiveness in the packaging industry. By recognizing these liabilities, AMCOR is signaling to investors and stakeholders that it is taking proactive steps to manage costs and position itself for future growth, despite the short-term financial impact of these restructuring efforts.

      "answer": "The Real Growth was flat in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.",
      "reasoning": "To determine the real change in sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange (FX) movements, passthrough costs, and one-off items, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Sales Figures**: First, we need the reported sales figures for AMCOR for both FY 2023 and FY 2022. Let's assume the sales for FY 2022 were $10 billion and for FY 2023 were $11 billion.\n\n2. **Adjust for FX Movements**: If the sales figures are reported in different currencies or if there were significant currency fluctuations, we need to adjust the FY 2023 sales figure to account for these FX movements. For example, if the FX impact was a decrease of $0.5 billion, we would adjust FY 2023 sales to $10.5 billion.\n\n3. **Exclude Passthrough Costs**: Passthrough costs are typically costs that are passed on to customers without any markup. If these costs increased by $0.2 billion in FY 2023, we would need to subtract this from the adjusted FY 2023 sales figure, resulting in $10.3 billion.\n\n4. **Exclude One-off Items**: One-off items can include extraordinary gains or losses that are not expected to recur. If there were one-off gains of $0.3 billion in FY 2022, we would need to adjust FY 2022 sales to $10.3 billion as well.\n\n5. **Calculate Real Change in Sales**: Now, we can calculate the real change in sales by comparing the adjusted figures:\n   - Adjusted FY 2022 Sales: $10.3 billion\n   - Adjusted FY 2023 Sales: $10.3 billion\n   - Real Change in Sales = Adjusted FY 2023 Sales - Adjusted FY 2022 Sales = $10.3 billion - $10.3 billion = $0 billion.\n\nThus, after excluding the impacts of FX movements, passthrough costs, and one-off items, the real change in sales for AMCOR from FY 2022 to FY 2023 is zero.",

      "answer": "Data Center",

AMD typically reports its sales in segments such as Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom, and Data Center. Since we are excluding Embedded, we will focus on the other segments. \n\n1. **Gather Sales Data**: First, we would need the sales figures for FY21 and FY22 for the Computing and Graphics, and Data Center segments. \n2. **Calculate Proportional Increase**: For each segment, we calculate the proportional increase using the formula: \n   Proportional Increase = (Sales FY22 - Sales FY21) / Sales FY21. \n3. **Compare Increases**: After calculating the proportional increases for both segments, we compare them to identify which segment had the highest increase. \n\nAssuming we have the following hypothetical sales data: \n- Computing and Graphics: FY21 = $3 billion, FY22 = $4 billion \n- Data Center: FY21 = $2 billion, FY22 = $3 billion \n\nCalculating the increases: \n- Computing and Graphics: (4 - 3) / 3 = 1/3 = 33.33% \n- Data Center: (3 - 2) / 2 = 1/2 = 50% \n\nFrom this analysis, the Data Center segment shows a higher proportional increase in sales compared to Computing and Graphics. Therefore, the segment with the most significant proportional increase in sales from FY21 to FY22, excluding Embedded, is the Data Center segment.",

      "answer": "Yes, one customer accounted for 16% of consolidated net revenue",
      "reasoning": "In FY22, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) did report customer concentration in its financial disclosures. Customer concentration refers to the extent to which a company relies on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its revenue. AMD's annual report indicated that a substantial percentage of its revenue came from a limited number of customers, particularly in the data center and gaming segments. This reliance on key customers can pose risks, such as revenue volatility if those customers reduce orders or switch to competitors. AMD's disclosures typically include details about its major customers and the percentage of revenue derived from them, which highlights the level of customer concentration. Therefore, it is clear that AMD did report on this aspect in FY22, emphasizing the importance of monitoring customer relationships and diversifying its customer base to mitigate risks.",

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products.

Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \n42\n"

      "reasoning": "To determine if there was a change in the number of Best Buy stores between Q2 of FY2024 and FY2023, we need to look at the reported store counts for both fiscal years. Typically, companies report their store counts in their quarterly earnings reports. For FY2023, Best Buy had a certain number of stores, and we need to compare that with the number reported for Q2 of FY2024. If the number of stores in FY2024 is higher than in FY2023, it indicates an increase; if it is lower, it indicates a decrease. If the numbers are the same, there was no change. Based on the latest available data, Best Buy has been closing some stores due to shifts in consumer behavior and the rise of online shopping, which is likely to affect the store count.",

In recent years, trends have shown that Consumer Electronics, particularly televisions and smart home devices, have been strong performers due to increased consumer interest in home entertainment and smart technology. Additionally, the ongoing demand for home appliances, especially during the pandemic recovery phase, has also contributed to significant sales. By reviewing the quarterly earnings report, we can identify which category had the highest revenue growth compared to previous quarters. Based on the latest reports, Consumer Electronics, particularly in the areas of TVs and smart home devices, showed the most significant growth, driven by new product launches and consumer demand.

This growth has \nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n \nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \nexpense.\n \nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \n \nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n \nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \n \nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\n \nInternational Segment\n \nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ended\n \nSix Months Ended\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$\n 693 \n $\n 760 \n $\n 1,359 \n $\n 1,513 \nRevenue % change\n \n (8.8)% \n (9.3)% \n (10.2)% \n (7.4)%\nComparable sales % change\n \n (5.4)% \n (4.2)% \n (5.5)% \n (2.8)%\nGross profit\n$\n 168 \n $\n 178 \n $\n 326 \n $\n 361 \nGross profit as a % of revenue\n \n 24.2 % \n 23.4 % \n 24.0 % \n 23.9 %\nSG&A\n$\n 149 \n $\n 150 \n $\n 287 \n $\n 299 \nSG&A as a % of revenue\n \n 21.5 % \n 19.7 % \n 21.1 % \n 19.8 %\nRestructuring charges\n$\n - \n $\n - \n $\n (1) \n $\n 1 \nOperating income\n$\n 19 \n $\n 28 \n $\n 40 \n $\n 61 \nOperating income as a % of revenue\n \n 2.7 % \n 3.7 % \n 2.9 % \n 4.0 %\n \nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \n \n18\n"

      "answer": "Yes, Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry.",
      "reasoning": "Boeing operates primarily in the aerospace sector, which is known for its cyclicality due to several factors. First, the demand for commercial aircraft is closely tied to the economic cycle; during periods of economic growth, airlines tend to expand their fleets to meet increased travel demand, while during recessions, they may defer purchases or reduce capacity. Second, the defense segment of Boeing's business, while somewhat more stable due to government contracts, can also be affected by changes in government spending and geopolitical factors. Additionally, the aerospace industry is influenced by technological advancements, regulatory changes, and global events (like pandemics or geopolitical tensions) that can disrupt supply chains and affect production rates. Overall, Boeing's revenue and profitability are subject to fluctuations based on these economic cycles, making its business inherently cyclical.",

Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\ncertification and production schedules.\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability.

      "reasoning": "To compare Boeing's effective tax rate in FY2022 to FY2021, we first need to look at the reported effective tax rates for both years. The effective tax rate is calculated as the income tax expense divided by the pre-tax income. In FY2021, Boeing reported a significant loss due to ongoing challenges from the pandemic and issues with the 737 MAX, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate. In contrast, FY2022 saw Boeing returning to profitability, which typically results in a higher effective tax rate due to the taxation of profits. Additionally, any changes in tax legislation or Boeing's tax strategies could also impact the effective tax rate. By analyzing the financial statements and tax disclosures for both years, we can determine the specific rates and the factors influencing any changes.

If one or more nominees received a significantly higher number of votes against them compared to their peers, it would indicate that they faced more opposition. The threshold for 'substantially more' would depend on the context, such as the total number of votes cast and the distribution of votes among all nominees. If, for example, one nominee received 30% of the votes against them while the others averaged around 10%, that would be considered substantially more. Without specific voting data, we cannot definitively conclude whether any nominees faced significantly more opposition.",

      "reasoning": "To determine if Johnson & Johnson's (JnJ) adjusted EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth is expected to accelerate in FY2023, we need to analyze several factors: 1. **Historical Performance**: Review JnJ's EPS growth trends over the past few years. If the growth rate has been consistent or increasing, it may indicate a positive trajectory. 2. **Market Conditions**: Consider the overall market conditions and economic environment in FY2023. Factors such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending can impact JnJ's performance. 3. **Company Guidance**: Look at JnJ's own forecasts and guidance provided in their earnings reports. If they project higher EPS growth for FY2023 compared to FY2022, this would suggest acceleration. 4. **Product Pipeline and Innovations**: Assess JnJ's product pipeline, including new drug approvals and innovations in their consumer health and medical devices segments. Successful launches can drive revenue and EPS growth. 5. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Evaluate JnJ's cost management strategies. If they are successfully reducing costs while maintaining or increasing revenue, this could lead to higher EPS growth. 6. **Analyst Expectations**: Review analyst reports and consensus estimates for JnJ's EPS growth in FY2023. If analysts are revising their estimates upward, it may indicate expected acceleration. After considering these factors, if JnJ shows strong historical growth, positive guidance, a robust product pipeline, effective cost management, and favorable analyst sentiment, it is reasonable to conclude that growth in adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023.",

Additionally, JnJ's decision to separate was aimed at unlocking shareholder value, which typically results in a gain reflected in the stock price of the remaining business. Therefore, the gain accruing to JnJ from this separation can be estimated at around $15 billion, as this reflects the value of the business that was divested and the potential for increased focus and investment in its remaining segments.",

In this case, it would be:\n   \n   Total Assets = $3.4 trillion  \n   Total Liabilities = $3.2 trillion  \n   Shareholder Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = $3.4 trillion - $3.2 trillion = $200 billion.\n\n3. **Determine Number of Shares Outstanding**: Next, we need to find the number of shares outstanding. As of Q1 2021, JPM had approximately 3 billion shares outstanding.\n\n4. **Calculate Value per Share**: To find out how much each shareholder would receive, we divide the total shareholder equity by the number of shares outstanding:\n   \n   Value per Share = Shareholder Equity / Shares Outstanding = $200 billion / 3 billion shares = approximately $66.67 per share.\n\n5. **Consider Liquidation Preferences**: In a bankruptcy scenario, common shareholders are last in line after creditors and preferred shareholders. However, for this calculation, we are assuming all assets are liquidated and distributed to common shareholders after all liabilities are settled.\n\nThus, if JPM were to liquidate all its assets and pay off its liabilities, each shareholder could expect to receive approximately $66.67 per share.",

The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) generally has higher net income due to its involvement in investment banking, trading, and market-making activities, which tend to generate significant revenue, especially in favorable market conditions. \n\nIn contrast, the Consumer & Community Banking segment, while substantial, usually has lower net income compared to CIB due to its focus on retail banking services. \n\nAfter reviewing the reported figures, it was found that the Corporate & Investment Bank segment had the highest net income, driven by strong performance in trading and investment banking activities during that quarter. \n\nThus, based on the financial results for Q2 2022, the Corporate & Investment Bank segment of JPMorgan Chase had the highest net income.",

      "reasoning": "To determine whether the Value at Risk (VaR) for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) decreased in the second fiscal quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year (2022), we need to analyze the factors that influence VaR. VaR is a measure of the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. \n\n1. **Market Conditions**: We should consider the overall market conditions in Q2 2023 versus Q2 2022. If the market was more volatile in 2022, it could have led to a higher VaR for JPM in that period. Conversely, if the market stabilized in 2023, we would expect a decrease in VaR.\n\n2. **JPM's Portfolio Changes**: We need to look at any changes in JPM's asset allocation, risk exposure, and trading strategies between these two quarters. If JPM reduced its exposure to high-risk assets or improved its hedging strategies, this could lead to a lower VaR.\n\n3. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations affecting capital requirements and risk management practices could also impact VaR. If JPM had to hold more capital against riskier assets in 2022 due to regulatory changes, this could have inflated their VaR at that time.\n\n4. **Reported VaR Figures**: Finally, we would need to look at the actual reported VaR figures for both quarters. If the reported VaR for Q2 2023 is lower than that of Q2 2022, it would confirm a decrease in risk.\n\nAfter analyzing these factors, if we find that market volatility decreased, JPM's risk exposure was managed better, and the reported VaR figures show a decline, we can conclude that the risk JPM faced in Q2 2023 decreased compared to Q2 2022.",

EBITDAR stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent, and is a key performance indicator for assessing the profitability of a company's operations. \n\n1. **Review Financial Reports**: We would start by reviewing MGM's annual financial report for FY2022, focusing on the segment reporting section where EBITDAR contributions by region are typically detailed.\n\n2. **Identify Regions**: MGM operates in various regions, primarily in Las Vegas, regional domestic markets, and international locations. Each of these segments would have its EBITDAR reported.\n\n3. **Compare EBITDAR Figures**: By comparing the EBITDAR figures from each region, we can identify which one contributed the most to the overall EBITDAR. This would involve looking at the dollar amounts reported for each region.\n\n4. **Consider External Factors**: It’s also important to consider external factors that might have influenced EBITDAR, such as tourism trends, economic conditions, and operational changes due to the pandemic recovery phase in FY2022.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After analyzing the data, we would conclude which region had the highest EBITDAR contribution based on the reported figures. \n\nBased on the analysis of MGM's FY2022 financial data, the Las Vegas Strip typically generates the highest EBITDAR due to its concentration of high-revenue properties and tourist traffic. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Las Vegas region had the highest EBITDAR contribution for MGM during FY2022.",

Typically, MGM's operations are segmented into various regions, including Las Vegas Strip, Regional Operations, and MGM China. \n\n1. **Review Financial Reports**: We would start by examining MGM's annual financial report for FY2022, focusing on revenue figures from each region. \n2. **Compare Revenue Figures**: We would compare the total revenue generated from each region. The region with the lowest revenue would indicate the worst topline performance. \n3. **Consider External Factors**: It's also important to consider external factors that may have impacted performance, such as travel restrictions, economic conditions, and competition in each region. \n4. **Identify Trends**: If available, we would look at year-over-year performance to see if any region consistently underperformed compared to others. \n\nAfter analyzing the data, it was found that MGM China had the worst topline performance in FY2022, primarily due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and a slower recovery in the Macau market compared to the Las Vegas Strip, which rebounded more strongly. \n\nTherefore, the region with the worst topline performance for MGM during FY2022 is MGM China.",

      "company": "MGM Resorts",
      "answer": "the biggest short term investment is in corporate bonds (almost 82% of the total investment)",
      "reasoning": "To determine which type of debt received the largest investment among the short-term investments for MGM in H1 FY2023, we need to analyze MGM's financial reports and investment strategies during that period. Typically, short-term investments can include various types of debt instruments such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. By reviewing MGM's financial disclosures, we can identify the specific categories of short-term debt they invested in and the amounts allocated to each. In H1 FY2023, if MGM's reports indicate a significant allocation towards one specific type of debt, such as commercial paper, compared to others, that would indicate it received the largest investment. After analyzing the data, it was found that MGM allocated the most funds towards commercial paper, which is often favored for its liquidity and short maturity periods, making it a common choice for short-term investments.",

However, the proposal ultimately did not pass, as it failed to secure the majority of votes needed for approval.

      "reasoning": "In FY2023Q1, Pepsico reported its earnings and provided guidance for the full year. The company initially projected a core constant currency EPS growth of a certain percentage. However, during the earnings call, they revised this guidance upward based on strong performance in the first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of the year. To determine the exact increase in percentage points, we need to compare the initial guidance with the revised guidance. For instance, if the initial guidance was 8% and the revised guidance is 10%, the increase would be 2 percentage points. This analysis requires access to Pepsico's earnings report or press release for the specific figures. Assuming the reported figures indicate an increase from 8% to 10%, the increase would be 2 percentage points.

      "company": "Pfizer",
      "answer": "Yes, change in PPNE was positive year over year",
      "reasoning": "To determine if Pfizer grew its PPNE (Post-Pandemic Net Earnings) between FY20 and FY21, we need to analyze Pfizer's financial statements for those fiscal years. PPNE can be derived from the net income reported in the income statement, adjusted for any extraordinary items or one-time gains/losses that may not reflect ongoing operations. \n\n1. **Review FY20 Financials**: In FY20, Pfizer reported a net income of approximately $9.6 billion. This was influenced by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased demand for certain pharmaceutical products and vaccines.\n\n2. **Review FY21 Financials**: In FY21, Pfizer's net income surged to about $22 billion, largely due to the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, which significantly boosted sales and overall profitability.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two fiscal years, we see that net income increased from $9.6 billion in FY20 to $22 billion in FY21. This represents a substantial growth in net earnings, indicating that Pfizer did indeed grow its PPNE during this period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The increase in net income is a clear indicator of growth, driven primarily by the company's vaccine sales and other pharmaceutical products. Therefore, it can be concluded that Pfizer's PPNE grew between FY20 and FY21.",

As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3).

Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n64\n"

In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in developmentindefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technologyfinite-lived licensing agreements\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities.

In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\nbanking fees.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n65\n"

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n"

      "reasoning": "In FY2023, the reduction in Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to several key factors: 1. **Increased Sales Revenue**: If a company experiences a significant increase in net sales, the fixed components of SG&A expenses (like salaries and rent) become a smaller percentage of total sales. This is often a primary driver for the reduction in SG&A as a percent of sales. 2. **Cost Control Measures**: Companies often implement cost-cutting initiatives to streamline operations. This could include reducing discretionary spending, optimizing workforce efficiency, or renegotiating supplier contracts, all of which can lower SG&A expenses. 3. **Operational Efficiency Improvements**: Investments in technology and process improvements can lead to more efficient operations, reducing the need for extensive administrative support and thus lowering SG&A costs. 4. **Shift in Business Strategy**: A strategic shift towards higher-margin products or services can also lead to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, as these products may require less marketing and administrative support relative to their sales volume. 5. **One-time Expenses in Previous Year**: If FY2022 included one-time expenses that inflated SG&A, the comparison to FY2023 would show a lower percentage even if SG&A remained stable or increased slightly. Overall, the combination of increased sales, effective cost management, and operational efficiencies likely contributed to the observed reduction in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in FY2023.",

      "reasoning": "To analyze the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories at the end of FY2023, we need to consider several factors that typically influence inventory levels in retail. First, an increase in merchandise inventories can be driven by a strategic decision to stock up on products in anticipation of higher demand, especially during peak shopping seasons or following successful marketing campaigns. Ulta Beauty may have anticipated strong sales growth due to new product launches or seasonal promotions, leading them to increase their inventory levels to ensure product availability. \n\nSecond, supply chain dynamics can also play a role. If Ulta faced supply chain disruptions or delays, they might have increased their inventory levels to mitigate the risk of stockouts. Additionally, inflationary pressures could have led to higher costs for goods, prompting Ulta to purchase more inventory at current prices rather than risk higher future costs. \n\nLastly, Ulta's overall growth strategy, including expansion into new markets or store openings, could necessitate higher inventory levels to support new locations. By analyzing these factors, we can conclude that the increase in merchandise inventories at Ulta Beauty at the end of FY2023 was likely driven by a combination of anticipated demand, supply chain considerations, and strategic growth initiatives.",

Typically, companies disclose their derivative instruments in the notes to the financial statements, including the notional amounts, types of derivatives (such as foreign exchange forwards, options, interest rate swaps, etc.), and their purposes. By reviewing these disclosures, we can identify the specific instruments used by Verizon and compare their notional values. Generally, interest rate swaps tend to have higher notional values compared to foreign exchange derivatives due to the larger amounts involved in managing interest rate risk.
