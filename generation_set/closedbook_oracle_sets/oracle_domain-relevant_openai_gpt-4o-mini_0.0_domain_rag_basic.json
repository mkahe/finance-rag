      "question": "Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?",
      "doc_name": "3M_2022_10K",
      "company": "3M",
      "answer": "No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:\nCAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%\nFixed assets/Total Assets: 20%\nReturn on Assets= 12.4%",
      "reasoning": "To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business, we can analyze the data provided in the financial documents. A capital-intensive business typically has a high level of fixed assets relative to its sales and cash flows. \n\n1. **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: In 2022, 3M's net PP&E is reported at $9,178 million. This is a significant investment in fixed assets, which is characteristic of capital-intensive industries.\n\n2. **Net Sales**: The net sales for 2022 are $34,229 million. To assess capital intensity, we can calculate the ratio of PP&E to net sales: \n   - PP&E to Net Sales Ratio = 9,178 / 34,229 ≈ 0.268 (or 26.8%). This indicates that approximately 27 cents of every dollar in sales is tied up in fixed assets.\n\n3. **Cash Flows from Operating Activities**: The net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 is $5,591 million. This is lower than the previous year (2021: $7,454 million), indicating potential challenges in generating cash flow, which can be a concern for capital-intensive businesses that require substantial cash for maintenance and expansion of their assets.\n\n4. **Investing Activities**: The cash outflow for purchases of PP&E in 2022 is $1,749 million, which further supports the notion that 3M is investing heavily in its capital assets.\n\nOverall, the significant investment in PP&E relative to sales, along with the cash flows associated with operating and investing activities, suggests that 3M operates in a capital-intensive industry. Therefore, based on the FY2022 data, 3M can be classified as a capital-intensive business.",
      "generated_answer": "Yes, 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data.",

      "reasoning": "The evidence indicates that SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative expenses) as a percentage of sales increased in 2022 compared to the previous year. This increase was primarily driven by significant special item costs, including a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to litigation, impairment costs from exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs associated with exiting Russia, and restructuring charges from divestitures. These costs represent substantial one-time expenses that can distort the operating margin metric. While there were some offsetting factors such as restructuring benefits and cost management, the overall impact of these significant charges likely led to a decrease in operating margin. Therefore, the operating margin may not be a useful metric for 3M in this context, as it is heavily influenced by these extraordinary items rather than ongoing operational performance.",
      "generated_answer": "The increase in SG&A due to significant special item costs, particularly litigation and restructuring charges, drove the change in operating margin for 3M in FY2022. Operating margin may not be a useful metric due to the impact of these one-time expenses.",

      "reasoning": "To determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, we first need to calculate the operating margin for the years provided. The operating margin is calculated as Operating Income divided by Total Revenue. \n\nFor FY2022:\n- Operating Income = $6,098 million\n- Total Revenue = $17,606 million\n- Operating Margin = (6,098 / 17,606) * 100 = 34.6%\n\nFor FY2021:\n- Operating Income = $5,802 million\n- Total Revenue = $15,785 million\n- Operating Margin = (5,802 / 15,785) * 100 = 36.8%\n\nFor FY2020:\n- Operating Income = $4,237 million\n- Total Revenue = $12,868 million\n- Operating Margin = (4,237 / 12,868) * 100 = 32.9%\n\nNow, comparing the operating margins:\n- FY2020: 32.9%\n- FY2021: 36.8%\n- FY2022: 34.6%\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the operating margin increased from FY2020 to FY2021 but decreased from FY2021 to FY2022. Therefore, while Adobe had an improving operating margin profile from FY2020 to FY2021, it did not maintain that improvement into FY2022. \n\nThus, Adobe does not have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, as the margin decreased compared to the previous year.",

      "answer": "AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.",
      "reasoning": "To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation for FY2022, we need to use the formula: \n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory.\n\nFrom Evidence 2, we have the total cost of sales for FY2022 as $10,069 million. \n\nFrom Evidence 1, the inventory at the end of FY2022 is $1,055 million. Since we only have the ending inventory for FY2022, we will assume that the beginning inventory for FY2022 is the ending inventory for FY2021, which is $604 million. \n\nNow, we can calculate the average inventory:\nAverage Inventory = (Ending Inventory + Beginning Inventory) / 2 = ($1,055 million + $604 million) / 2 = $829.5 million.\n\nNow we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory = $10,069 million / $829.5 million ≈ 12.14.\n\nThis means that AES Corporation sold its inventory roughly 12 times in FY2022. However, it is important to note that AES Corporation operates in the energy sector, which may not rely heavily on traditional inventory management practices as seen in retail or manufacturing sectors. Instead, their inventory may consist of materials and supplies that are not sold in the same manner as typical inventory, making conventional inventory turnover metrics less meaningful for assessing operational efficiency.",

Pro forma information related to\nthese acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.\nDisposal of Russian business\n On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash\nproceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale follows the Companys previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its\nRussian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was $365 million and resulted in a\npre-tax net gain of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the\nwide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business has been\nrecorded as restructuring, impairment, and other related activities, net within the consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a\nnet carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million,\nprimarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nYear ended June 30, 2022\n During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the disposal of non-core assets in the Flexibles reporting segment.

      "question": "Does AMCOR have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
      "doc_name": "AMCOR_2023_10K",
      "company": "Amcor",
      "answer": "No. For AMCOR there has been a slight decline in gross margins by 0.8%.",
      "reasoning": "To determine if Amcor has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023, we need to calculate the gross margin for each year provided. Gross margin is calculated as (Gross Profit / Net Sales) x 100. \n\nFor FY2023:\n- Gross Profit = $2,725 million\n- Net Sales = $14,694 million\n- Gross Margin = (2,725 / 14,694) x 100 = 18.52%\n\nFor FY2022:\n- Gross Profit = $2,820 million\n- Net Sales = $14,544 million\n- Gross Margin = (2,820 / 14,544) x 100 = 19.39%\n\nFor FY2021:\n- Gross Profit = $2,732 million\n- Net Sales = $12,861 million\n- Gross Margin = (2,732 / 12,861) x 100 = 21.24%\n\nNow, comparing the gross margins:\n- FY2021: 21.24%\n- FY2022: 19.39%\n- FY2023: 18.52%\n\nThe gross margin has decreased from FY2021 to FY2023, indicating that Amcor does not have an improving gross margin profile. The decline in gross margin suggests that either costs are rising faster than sales or pricing power is weakening, which is not favorable for profitability. \n\nAdditionally, while gross margin is a useful metric for many companies, for a company like Amcor, which operates in the packaging industry, it may not fully capture operational efficiency or profitability due to the nature of its business, where cost of sales can be heavily influenced by raw material prices and other external factors. Therefore, while gross margin is relevant, it should be considered alongside other metrics such as operating margin and net profit margin for a comprehensive analysis.",

      "reasoning": "To assess AMD's liquidity profile using the quick ratio, we first need to calculate the quick assets and current liabilities. The quick ratio is defined as (Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = $15,019 million\n- Inventories = $3,771 million\n- Prepaid Expenses = $1,265 million\n- Current Liabilities = $6,369 million\n\nCalculating quick assets:\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Expenses\nQuick Assets = $15,019 - $3,771 - $1,265 = $9,983 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the quick ratio:\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = $9,983 million / $6,369 million ≈ 1.57\n\nA quick ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more quick assets than current liabilities, suggesting a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. Therefore, AMD's quick ratio of approximately 1.57 indicates that it is in a good position to cover its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory.",

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.

      "answer": "The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition",
      "reasoning": "The evidence indicates that AMD's operating income decreased from $3.6 billion in 2021 to $1.3 billion in 2022, which represents a significant decline. This decrease is attributed to the amortization of intangible assets related to the Xilinx acquisition. Amortization is a non-cash expense that reduces operating income but does not affect cash flow. Therefore, while the operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenue) may have changed due to this decline in operating income, it may not accurately reflect the company's operational efficiency or profitability, especially in the context of significant acquisitions that involve substantial amortization costs. In such cases, operating margin can be misleading as it does not account for the underlying cash-generating ability of the business. Thus, while the operating margin may have decreased, it is not a fully useful metric for assessing AMD's performance in FY22 due to the impact of acquisition-related amortization.",

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, us, our or AMD), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes).

      "reasoning": "To determine which category of cash flow (operating, investing, or financing) brought in the most cash for AMD in FY22, we need to analyze the net cash provided by each activity:\n\n1. **Operating Activities**: The net cash provided by operating activities for FY22 is $3,565 million.\n2. **Investing Activities**: The net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for FY22 is $1,999 million. This indicates a net inflow of cash.\n3. **Financing Activities**: The net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for FY22 is -$3,264 million, indicating a net outflow of cash.\n\nComparing these figures:\n- Operating activities: +$3,565 million\n- Investing activities: +$1,999 million\n- Financing activities: -$3,264 million\n\nClearly, the operating activities brought in the most cash flow, followed by investing activities, while financing activities resulted in a cash outflow.

      "company": "American Express",
      "answer": "Performance is not measured through operating margin",
      "reasoning": "To assess whether AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022, we need to calculate the operating margin for the years provided. The operating margin is calculated as (Operating Income / Total Revenues) x 100. \n\n1. **Calculate Operating Income**: \n   Operating Income = Total Revenues - Total Expenses \n   - For 2022: Total Revenues = 52,862 million, Total Expenses = 41,095 million \n   Operating Income (2022) = 52,862 - 41,095 = 11,767 million \n   - For 2021: Total Revenues = 42,380 million, Total Expenses = 33,110 million \n   Operating Income (2021) = 42,380 - 33,110 = 9,270 million \n   - For 2020: Total Revenues = 36,087 million, Total Expenses = 27,061 million \n   Operating Income (2020) = 36,087 - 27,061 = 9,026 million \n\n2. **Calculate Operating Margin**: \n   Operating Margin = (Operating Income / Total Revenues) x 100 \n   - For 2022: Operating Margin = (11,767 / 52,862) x 100 = 22.24% \n   - For 2021: Operating Margin = (9,270 / 42,380) x 100 = 21.85% \n   - For 2020: Operating Margin = (9,026 / 36,087) x 100 = 24.98% \n\n3. **Analyze the trend**: \n   - The operating margin increased from 21.85% in 2021 to 22.24% in 2022, indicating an improvement. However, it decreased from 24.98% in 2020 to 21.85% in 2021, suggesting a decline in the previous year. \n   - Overall, while there is a slight improvement from 2021 to 2022, the operating margin is still lower than in 2020, indicating inconsistency in the operating margin profile. \n\n4. **Conclusion**: While there is a marginal improvement in the operating margin from 2021 to 2022, the overall trend shows a decline from 2020, which may suggest that operating margin is not consistently improving. However, AMEX's business model, which relies heavily on non-interest revenues, may make operating margin less relevant as a performance metric compared to other metrics like net income or return on equity.",
      "generated_answer": "AMEX has a marginal improvement in operating margin from 2021 to 2022, but the overall trend shows a decline from 2020, indicating inconsistency. Operating margin may not be the most relevant metric for AMEX due to its reliance on non-interest revenues.",

      "company": "American Express",
      "answer": "Performance is not measured through gross margin",
      "reasoning": "To analyze the gross margin change for American Express in FY2022, we first need to understand what gross margin represents. Gross margin is typically calculated as revenues minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). However, for a financial services company like American Express, the concept of gross margin is less applicable because they do not sell physical goods but rather provide services and earn revenues from fees and interest. \n\nIn the provided financial statements, we see that total revenues (net of interest expense) for FY2022 were $52,862 million, while total expenses were $41,095 million, leading to a pretax income of $9,585 million. The significant components of expenses include card member rewards, business development, and salaries, which are not directly tied to a traditional COGS. \n\nThe increase in revenues from $42,380 million in FY2021 to $52,862 million in FY2022 indicates strong growth in both non-interest revenues and interest income. However, the expenses also increased significantly, from $33,110 million in FY2021 to $41,095 million in FY2022. \n\nGiven that gross margin is not a relevant metric for a service-oriented financial institution, it is more appropriate to focus on net income and pretax income as indicators of profitability. Therefore, the change in gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express, as their revenue generation and cost structure do not align with traditional gross margin calculations.",

      "answer": "No, American Water Works had negative working capital of -$1561M in FY 2022.",
      "reasoning": "To determine if American Water Works has positive working capital, we need to calculate working capital using the formula: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. From the evidence provided:\n\n- Total current assets for FY2022 = $1,250 million\n- Total current liabilities for FY2022 = $2,811 million\n\nNow, substituting these values into the formula:\n\nWorking Capital = $1,250 million - $2,811 million = -$1,561 million.\n\nSince the working capital is negative, this indicates that the company has more current liabilities than current assets, which means it does not have positive working capital. \n\nAdditionally, for a utility company like American Water Works, working capital may not be the most relevant metric due to the nature of its operations, which often involve stable cash flows and long-term contracts. Utilities typically manage their cash flow differently than other industries, focusing more on long-term financial health rather than short-term liquidity.",

      "company": "Best Buy",
      "answer": "Best Buy generated the most cash flow from operating activities in FY 2023 ($1.8 bn)",
      "reasoning": "To determine which activity brought in the most cash flow for Best Buy in FY2023, we need to analyze the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as provided in the evidence. \n\n1. **Operating Activities**: The total cash provided by operating activities in FY2023 is $1,824 million. This is the cash generated from the company's core business operations.\n\n2. **Investing Activities**: The total cash used in investing activities in FY2023 is $(962) million. This indicates a cash outflow, as the company spent more on investments than it received from sales of investments.\n\n3. **Financing Activities**: The total cash used in financing activities in FY2023 is $(1,806) million. This also represents a cash outflow, primarily due to stock repurchases and dividends paid.\n\nNow, comparing the cash flows:\n- Operating activities: +$1,824 million (inflow)\n- Investing activities: -$962 million (outflow)\n- Financing activities: -$1,806 million (outflow)\n\nAmong these, operating activities generated the highest cash inflow, while both investing and financing activities resulted in cash outflows. Therefore, operating activities brought in the most cash flow for Best Buy in FY2023.",

During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice\nthat resolved the Department of Justices previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company\nreceiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A.

      "company": "Boeing",
      "answer": "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.",
      "reasoning": "To assess whether Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022, we need to calculate the gross margin for the years provided. Gross margin is calculated as (Total Revenues - Cost of Goods Sold) / Total Revenues. For Boeing, the relevant costs are the cost of products and the cost of services. \n\n1. **Calculate Gross Margin for FY2022:**  \n   - Total Revenues (2022) = $66,608 million  \n   - Total Costs (2022) = Cost of Products + Cost of Services = $53,969 million + $9,109 million = $63,078 million  \n   - Gross Margin (2022) = (66,608 - 63,078) / 66,608 = 0.039 or 3.9%  \n\n2. **Calculate Gross Margin for FY2021:**  \n   - Total Revenues (2021) = $62,286 million  \n   - Total Costs (2021) = Cost of Products + Cost of Services = $49,954 million + $9,283 million = $59,237 million  \n   - Gross Margin (2021) = (62,286 - 59,237) / 62,286 = 0.049 or 4.9%  \n\n3. **Calculate Gross Margin for FY2020:**  \n   - Total Revenues (2020) = $58,158 million  \n   - Total Costs (2020) = Cost of Products + Cost of Services = $54,568 million + $9,232 million = $63,800 million  \n   - Gross Margin (2020) = (58,158 - 63,800) / 58,158 = -0.096 or -9.6%  \n\n**Analysis of Gross Margin Trends:**  \n- FY2020: -9.6% (loss)  \n- FY2021: 4.9% (improvement)  \n- FY2022: 3.9% (decline from FY2021)  \n\nWhile there was a significant improvement from FY2020 to FY2021, the gross margin declined from FY2021 to FY2022. Therefore, Boeing does not have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. \n\nAdditionally, gross margin may not be the most useful metric for Boeing, as it is a capital-intensive company with significant fixed costs and long-term contracts. The overall profitability and cash flow generation may be more relevant metrics for assessing Boeing's financial health than gross margin alone.",

Specifically, Evidence 1 highlights that a limited number of commercial airlines contribute significantly to their revenue, while Evidence 2 emphasizes that a substantial portion comes from the U.S. government. Furthermore, Evidence 3 quantifies this by stating that 40% of Boeing's revenues in 2022 were from U.S. government contracts. Therefore, the primary customers of Boeing as of FY2022 are commercial airlines and the U.S. government, with a notable emphasis on government contracts.",

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n"

Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n8\n"

We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

      "doc_name": "CVSHEALTH_2022_10K",
      "company": "CVS Health",
      "answer": "Yes, CVS Health requires an extensive asset base to operate, which is evident from its ROA of only 1.82% in 2022 and 3.39% in 2021, though it should be noted that a significant portion of this asset base is goodwill, and CVS's fixed assets/total assets ratio is on the lower side of 5.6%.",
      "reasoning": "To determine if CVS Health is a capital-intensive business, we need to analyze its asset structure and operating costs. A capital-intensive business typically has a high level of fixed assets relative to its revenues. \n\nFrom the balance sheet (Evidence 2), CVS Health has total assets of $228,275 million, with significant investments in property and equipment ($12,873 million) and goodwill ($78,150 million). The presence of substantial long-term investments ($21,096 million) also indicates a reliance on capital assets. \n\nIn terms of operating costs (Evidence 1), CVS has a total operating cost of $314,721 million, which includes costs associated with products sold and other operational expenses. The high operating costs relative to revenues ($322,467 million) suggest that CVS is investing heavily in its operations, which is characteristic of capital-intensive businesses. \n\nAdditionally, the company has significant liabilities, including interest expenses ($2,287 million), which further indicates a reliance on capital financing. \n\nOverall, the combination of high total assets, significant investments in fixed assets, and substantial operating costs suggests that CVS Health operates as a capital-intensive business.",
      "generated_answer": "Yes, CVS Health is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data.",

      "doc_name": "CVSHEALTH_2022_10K",
      "company": "CVS Health",
      "answer": "Yes, CVS Health has been involved in multiple ongoing legal battles. Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVSâs retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees",
      "reasoning": "The evidence provided indicates that CVS Health is currently involved in several significant legal battles. Evidence 1 mentions ongoing litigation regarding usual and customary pricing, where the company is accused of overcharging for prescription drugs. Evidence 2 highlights multiple lawsuits related to drug pricing and rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers, indicating a broader issue with pricing practices. Furthermore, Evidence 3 discusses a formal settlement agreement reached in December 2022 concerning opioid claims, which is a substantial financial commitment of approximately $4.3 billion over 10 years. This suggests that CVS Health has been engaged in important legal disputes not only in 2022 but also likely extending back to 2021 and 2020, as these issues often take time to develop and resolve. Therefore, it can be concluded that CVS Health has reported materially important ongoing legal battles from the years 2022, 2021, and 2020.",

This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n"

The breakdown of the sales increase shows that while volume contributed positively to sales growth (6.9% in 2022 compared to 12.9% in 2021), price changes had a negative impact (-0.8% in 2022 vs. -0.7% in 2021), and currency fluctuations negatively affected sales by 4.8% in 2022, contrasting with a positive impact of 1.4% in 2021. The overall trend indicates a slowdown in growth, particularly when compared to the previous fiscal year.

      "answer": "For FY22, JnJ had changes in gross margin due to: One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, partially offset by Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.",
      "reasoning": "To analyze the change in gross margin for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) in FY2022, we need to consider the factors affecting both earnings and costs. The consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased from $22.8 billion in 2021 to $21.7 billion in 2022, indicating a decline in profitability. The percentage of earnings to sales also fell from 24.3% in 2021 to 22.9% in 2022, suggesting a decrease in gross margin. \n\nThe evidence points to several factors that contributed to this decline in gross margin: \n1. **Increased Cost of Products Sold**: The cost of products sold increased as a percentage of sales due to several reasons, including one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, and commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments. These factors would have increased the overall costs, thereby reducing the gross margin. \n2. **Intangible Asset Amortization**: The amortization expense included in the cost of products sold decreased slightly from $4.7 billion in 2021 to $4.3 billion in 2022, which may have had a minor positive effect on gross margin, but it was not enough to offset the other negative impacts. \n3. **Supply Chain Benefits**: There were some supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment, but these were not sufficient to counterbalance the overall increase in costs. \n\nGiven these points, the primary drivers of the gross margin change for JnJ in FY2022 were the increased costs associated with the COVID-19 vaccine exit, currency impacts, and commodity inflation, which outweighed any benefits from supply chain efficiencies.",

      "answer": "JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.",
      "reasoning": "To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) for FY2022, we need to use the formula: \n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory.\n\nFrom the evidence provided:\n- Cost of Products Sold (COGS) for FY2022 is $31,089 million.\n- To find the average inventory, we need the inventory values at the beginning and end of the fiscal year. The inventory at the end of FY2022 is $12,483 million (as of January 1, 2023), and the inventory at the end of FY2021 is $10,387 million (as of January 2, 2022).\n\nAverage Inventory = (Ending Inventory + Beginning Inventory) / 2 = ($12,483 million + $10,387 million) / 2 = $11,435 million.\n\nNow, we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = $31,089 million / $11,435 million ≈ 2.72.\n\nThis means that JnJ sold its inventory roughly 2.72 times in FY2022. \n\nRegarding conventional inventory management, JnJ operates in the pharmaceutical and consumer health sectors, where inventory management can be complex due to factors like product shelf life, regulatory requirements, and the nature of the products. Therefore, while the inventory turnover ratio provides some insight, it may not fully reflect the efficiency of inventory management in such industries, where inventory levels can be influenced by factors beyond simple sales volume.",

      "answer": "Since JPM is a financial institution, gross margin is not a relevant metric.",
      "reasoning": "Gross margins are typically used to assess the profitability of companies that sell goods, as they represent the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS). However, JPMorgan Chase is primarily a financial services firm, which means its revenue is generated from services such as investment banking, asset management, and transaction processing rather than from selling physical products. Therefore, gross margins may not be a relevant metric for evaluating JPMorgan Chase's financial performance. Instead, metrics such as net interest margin, return on equity, or efficiency ratios would be more appropriate for assessing a financial institution's profitability and operational efficiency.",

For long-term debt, FY2023 shows $41,990 million, while FY2022 had $47,032 million, indicating a decrease of $5,042 million in long-term debt. Overall, the total liabilities for FY2023 are $205,753 million, compared to $198,298 million in FY2022, which shows an increase of $7,455 million in total liabilities.

      "answer": "Yes. Paypal has a positive working capital of $ 1.6Bn as of FY2022 end.",
      "reasoning": "To determine if PayPal has positive working capital, we need to calculate working capital using the formula: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. From the provided balance sheet data for FY2022:\n\n- Total Current Assets = $57,517 million\n- Total Current Liabilities = $45,101 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the working capital:\n\nWorking Capital = $57,517 million - $45,101 million = $12,416 million.\n\nSince the working capital is positive ($12,416 million), it indicates that PayPal has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. Therefore, working capital is a relevant metric for assessing PayPal's short-term financial health.",

      "company": "Verizon",
      "answer": "No. The quick ratio was approximately 0.54 for Verizon. It indicated that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.",
      "reasoning": "To assess Verizon's liquidity profile using the quick ratio, we first need to calculate the quick assets and current liabilities. Quick assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (net), and any other liquid assets, excluding inventories and prepaid expenses. \n\nFrom the evidence:\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $2,605 million\n- Accounts receivable (net): $24,506 million\n- Inventories: $2,388 million (not included in quick assets)\n- Prepaid expenses: $8,358 million (not included in quick assets)\n\nQuick assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable = $2,605 million + $24,506 million = $27,111 million.\n\nCurrent liabilities total $50,171 million as provided in the evidence. \n\nNow, we can calculate the quick ratio:\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = $27,111 million / $50,171 million = 0.54.\n\nA quick ratio of 0.54 indicates that Verizon does not have enough quick assets to cover its current liabilities, which suggests a less favorable liquidity position. Generally, a quick ratio below 1.0 indicates potential liquidity issues, as it shows that the company may not be able to meet its short-term obligations without selling inventory or relying on other less liquid assets. Therefore, based on the quick ratio, Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for FY 2022.",

      "doc_name": "VERIZON_2022_10K",
      "company": "Verizon",
      "answer": "Yes. Verizon's capital intensity ratio was approximately 2.774729. This means that it took approximately $2.77 of assets to generate $1 of revenue and thus, Verizon can be considered capital intensive.",
      "reasoning": "To determine if Verizon is a capital-intensive business, we can analyze its financial data, particularly focusing on its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and total assets. In FY 2022, Verizon reported total assets of $379,680 million, with a significant portion allocated to PP&E, which amounted to $107,434 million (net of accumulated depreciation). This indicates a substantial investment in physical assets necessary for its operations, typical of capital-intensive industries. Additionally, the company has a relatively high level of fixed assets compared to its operating revenues, which were $136,835 million for the same period. The ratio of PP&E to total assets is approximately 28.3%, which is indicative of a capital-intensive business model, as it suggests that a large portion of the company's resources is tied up in long-term physical assets rather than in liquid or current assets. Furthermore, the nature of Verizon's business in telecommunications, which requires significant infrastructure investment, supports the conclusion that it is indeed capital-intensive.",

Although such transactions are excluded \nfrom the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these \ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \nregarding Corporate and other results. \nCapital Expenditures and Investments \nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \nin the information economy. \nGlobal Network and Technology \nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \nboth 4G and 5G customers. \nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\nefficient manner. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \nresults.

Since $150,639 (2022) is less than $150,868 (2021), this indicates that Verizon has decreased its total debt on the balance sheet from 2021 to 2022.
