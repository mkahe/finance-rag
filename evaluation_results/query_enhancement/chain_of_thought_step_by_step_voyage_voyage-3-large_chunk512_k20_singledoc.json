These documents typically contain the necessary financial data.\n   - Alternatively, quarterly reports (10-Q) can be used if they provide the needed information for the specific fiscal years.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - From the **Statement of Income** for each fiscal year, identify the total revenue.\n   - From the **Cash Flow Statement**, find the capital expenditures (capex) for each of the fiscal years.\n\n4. **Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue**:\n   - For each fiscal year, calculate capex as a percentage of revenue using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Capex as \\% of Revenue} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Capex}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compute the 3-Year Average**:\n   - Calculate the average of the capex as a percentage of revenue for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019.\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer**:\n   - Round the final average percentage to one decimal place and present the answer in units of percent.\n\n7. **Source Verification**:\n   - Ensure that all calculations are verified against the original financial statements for accuracy.",

Calculate the operating cash flow ratio:\n   - Use the formula: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Cash from Operations / Total Current Liabilities.\n   - Ensure that both figures used in the calculation are from the fiscal year 2015.\n\n3. Present the answer:\n   - Round the calculated operating cash flow ratio to two decimal places.\n\n4.

This information can typically be found in:\n   - Annual Reports\n   - Quarterly Reports (if annual reports are not available)\n\n3. **Find Unadjusted Operating Income**: \n   - For FY2015, locate the figure for unadjusted operating income on the income statement.\n   - For FY2016, locate the figure for unadjusted operating income on the income statement.\n\n4. **Calculate the Year-Over-Year Change**: \n   - Use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Year-Over-Year Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Operating Income FY2016} - \\text{Operating Income FY2015}}{\\text{Operating Income FY2015}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - This will give you the change in operating income as a percentage.\n\n5. **Round the Result**: Round the final percentage result to one decimal place for clarity.\n\n6. **Present the Answer**: Clearly state the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 in percentage terms. \n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically determine Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income.",

Typically, it is the ratio of Free Cash Flow to Net Income.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Financial Reports**:\n   - Look for Adobe's **Annual Report (10-K)** for FY2022 to find comprehensive financial statements.\n   - Check **Quarterly Reports (10-Q)** for FY2022 to see any trends in Free Cash Flow and Net Income over the quarters.\n   - Review **Earnings Call Transcripts** or **Earnings Discussions** for management commentary on Free Cash Flow performance.\n\n3. **Extract Financial Data**:\n   - From the Annual Report, locate the **Net Income** figure for FY2022.\n   - From the same report or quarterly reports, find the **Free Cash Flow** figure for FY2022.\n\n4. **Calculate Free Cash Flow Conversion**:\n   - Use the formula: Free Cash Flow Conversion = Free Cash Flow / Net Income.\n   - Perform the calculation for FY2022.\n\n5. **Analyze Historical Data**:\n   - Compare the Free Cash Flow conversion ratio from FY2022 with previous fiscal years (e.g., FY2021, FY2020) to assess whether there is an improvement.\n\n6. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Conclude whether Adobe's Free Cash Flow conversion is improving based on the calculated ratios and historical comparisons.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to determine the trend in Adobe's Free Cash Flow conversion as of FY2022.",

This information can typically be found in the annual report or quarterly reports.\n   - Find the average inventory for AES Corporation for FY2022. This can also be sourced from the annual report or quarterly reports.\n\n3. **Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\n   - Use the formula for inventory turnover ratio: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n     \\]\n   - Perform the calculation using the data gathered in the previous step.\n\n4. **Assess the Relevance of Inventory Management:**\n   - Determine if conventional inventory management practices apply to AES Corporation. \n   - If they do not apply, provide a brief explanation of why this is the case (e.g., nature of the business, industry practices, etc.).\n\n5. **Compile Findings:**\n   - Summarize the calculated inventory turnover ratio.\n   - State whether conventional inventory management is meaningful for AES Corporation and provide the reasoning behind your conclusion. \n\nBy following these steps, you will have a clear and structured approach to answering the original question regarding AES Corporation's inventory turnover for FY2022.",

Consider factors such as industry standards, business model, or other financial metrics that may be more relevant.\n\n5. **Source Information**: \n   - Ensure that the information is sourced from reliable financial documents such as annual reports, quarterly reports, and earnings discussions or calls.\n\nBy following these steps, you can clearly assess AMCOR's gross margin performance and its relevance to the company's financial assessment for FY2023.",

Common metrics may include revenue growth rate, earnings per share (EPS) growth, and net income growth.\n\n2. **Review FY2022 Annual Report**: Where can I find the detailed financial information for JnJ for the fiscal year 2022? This will typically be in the FY2022 annual report, which includes comprehensive financial statements and management discussion.\n\n3. **Examine Quarterly Reports**: Should I also look at JnJ's quarterly reports from FY2022 to identify trends in growth over the year? This may provide insights into quarterly performance and growth consistency.\n\n4. **Analyze Earnings Calls and Discussions**: Are there any insights from earnings calls or discussions that highlight JnJ's growth strategy or outlook for future growth? These can provide context on management's perspective regarding growth.\n\n5. **Compare with Industry Benchmarks**: How does JnJ's growth compare to industry benchmarks or competitors? This comparison can help contextualize whether JnJ is truly a high growth company relative to others in the same sector.\n\nBy following these steps, I can gather the necessary information to assess whether JnJ's FY2022 financials indicate that it is a high growth company.",

Consider factors such as the nature of JnJ's business model (e.g., pharmaceutical vs. consumer goods), inventory types, or operational strategies that may influence the significance of this ratio.\n\nStep 6: Compile the findings.  \n- Present the calculated inventory turnover ratio and any relevant commentary on its applicability to JnJ's business model.",

This report typically includes the balance sheet and the profit and loss (P&L) statement.\n\n2. **Extract Revenue Information**: \n   - Find the total revenue figure for FY2020 from the P&L statement. This will be the numerator for calculating the asset turnover ratio.\n\n3. **Gather Total Assets**: \n   - Look at the balance sheet and identify the total assets for FY2019 and FY2020. You will need both of these figures to calculate the average total assets.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Total Assets**: \n   - Use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Total Assets FY2019} + \\text{Total Assets FY2020}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Asset Turnover Ratio**: \n   - Use the formula for the asset turnover ratio:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{FY2020 Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Round the Result**: \n   - Once you have calculated the asset turnover ratio, round your final answer to two decimal places.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to calculate Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio accurately.",

In this case, the period is from FY2020 to FY2022.\n\n2. **Gather Revenue Data**: \n   - Locate Lockheed Martin's total revenue figures for FY2020 and FY2022. This information can typically be found in the annual reports or the statement of income for those respective years.\n\n3. **Calculate the CAGR**: \n   - Use the formula for CAGR, which is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Ending Value}}{\\text{Beginning Value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} - 1\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - **Ending Value** is the total revenue for FY2022.\n     - **Beginning Value** is the total revenue for FY2020.\n     - **n** is the number of years between the two periods (in this case, 2 years).\n\n4. **Convert to Percentage**: Multiply the CAGR result by 100 to express it in percentage terms.\n\n5. **Round the Result**: Round the final percentage to one decimal place for clarity.\n\n6. **Source of Information**: Confirm that the data used for this calculation comes primarily from the statement of income section of Lockheed Martin's annual reports for FY2020 and FY2022.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to provide a clear and precise answer to the original question regarding Lockheed Martin's revenue CAGR.",

The statement of income (also known as the income statement) will contain the necessary figures.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - For each fiscal year (FY2016, FY2017, FY2018), find the total revenue and the total cost of goods sold (COGS) from the statement of income.\n\n4. **Calculate COGS as a Percentage of Revenue**:\n   - For each fiscal year, use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{COGS \\%} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Perform this calculation for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018.\n\n5. **Compute the Three-Year Average**:\n   - Add the COGS percentages obtained for the three years.\n   - Divide the total by 3 to find the average percentage.\n\n6. **Format the Final Answer**:\n   - Round the average percentage to one decimal place.\n\n7. **Present the Answer**: \n   - State the three-year average of COGS as a percentage of revenue for Nike from FY2016 to FY2018, ensuring it is in units of percent.\n\nBy following these steps, you will arrive at a clear and accurate answer to the question.",

    "expanded_query": "Step-by-Step Question:\n\n1. **Identify the Fiscal Year**: Specify that we are focusing on Nike's financial performance for the fiscal year 2023 (FY2023).\n\n2. **Categorize Cash Flows**: Break down the cash flow into three distinct categories:\n   - **Operating Activities**: Determine the cash flow generated or used by Nike's core business operations.\n   - **Investing Activities**: Identify the cash flow resulting from investments in assets, acquisitions, or sales of investments.\n   - **Financing Activities**: Assess the cash flow related to borrowing, repaying debt, issuing stock, or paying dividends.\n\n3. **Analyze Cash Flow Figures**: \n   - For each category, find the specific cash flow figures reported in Nike's financial statements.\n   - Compare the cash flows from each category to see which one had the highest inflow or the lowest outflow.\n\n4. **Source of Information**: Specify where to find this information:\n   - Look at Nike's **annual report** for comprehensive data on cash flows for FY2023.\n   - Review **quarterly reports** for additional insights or trends throughout the year.\n   - Consider **earnings discussions** or conference calls for management's commentary on cash flow performance.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Summarize which category of cash flow (operating, investing, or financing) contributed the most to cash inflow or incurred the least cash outflow for Nike in FY2023. \n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically determine the cash flow performance of Nike across its operational, investing, and financing activities for the specified fiscal year.",

This could be an annual report or quarterly report.\n\n2. **Locate the Income Statement**: Within the identified financial document, find the section that contains the income statement for FY2022.\n\n3. **Search for Restructuring Costs**: Look for a line item or note specifically mentioning \"restructuring costs\" in the income statement. \n\n4. **Record the Amount**: If restructuring costs are explicitly mentioned, note the quantity stated. If they are not mentioned, record the quantity as 0.\n\n5. **Clarify Findings**: State clearly whether the restructuring costs were found and what the amount is, or confirm that the amount is 0 if not explicitly outlined.\n\nBy following these steps, the question becomes clearer and easier to answer systematically.",

Identify the specific geographic regions where Pfizer operates. \n   - This information can typically be found in Pfizer's annual reports or quarterly earnings discussions.\n\n2. Obtain the Q2 2023 revenue figures for each geographic region. \n   - Look for this data in Pfizer's Q2 2023 quarterly report.\n\n3. Find the year-over-year revenue figures for Q2 2022 for each of the same geographic regions. \n   - This information can also be located in the Q2 2022 quarterly report or in the annual report for 2022.\n\n4. Calculate the percentage change in revenue for each geographic region from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023. \n   - Use the formula: [(Revenue in Q2 2023 - Revenue in Q2 2022) / Revenue in Q2 2022] x 100.\n\n5. Identify which geographic region experienced the largest percentage decrease in revenue. \n   - This will involve comparing the calculated percentage changes for each region.\n\n6. Summarize the findings to clearly state which geographic region had the biggest drop in Q2 2023 year-over-year revenues on a percentage basis. \n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to accurately determine the geographic region with the most significant revenue decline for Pfizer in Q2 2023 compared to the previous year.",

This information can typically be found in the annual report or the 10-K filing.\n\n2. **Determine Q4 Stock Repurchases for FY 2023**:\n   - Find the specific amount spent on stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. This detail may be available in the quarterly report (10-Q) for Q4 or in the earnings discussion for that quarter.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - Use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage of Q4 Repurchases} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Q4 Stock Repurchases}}{\\text{Total Stock Repurchases for FY 2023}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Ensure to perform the calculation using the figures obtained from steps 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Source Verification**:\n   - Confirm that the data used for the calculations comes from reliable and relevant sources, such as the annual report for total repurchases and the quarterly report for Q4 repurchases.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine what percentage of Ulta Beauty's total spend on stock repurchases for FY 2023 occurred in Q4 of FY 2023.",

    "expanded_query": "To determine if Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on FY 2022 data, please follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Capital Intensity**: \n   - What is meant by \"capital-intensive\"? Generally, this refers to businesses that require significant investment in physical assets (like property, plant, and equipment) relative to their revenue.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Financial Metrics**:\n   - What key financial metrics should be examined to assess capital intensity? Consider looking at:\n     - Capital Expenditures (CapEx) for FY 2022.\n     - Total Revenue for FY 2022.\n     - Depreciation and Amortization expenses for FY 2022.\n\n3. **Locate the Data Sources**:\n   - Where can this data be found? \n     - Review Verizon's **Annual Report (10-K)** for FY 2022 for comprehensive financial statements and discussions.\n     - Check **Quarterly Reports (10-Q)** for any updates or additional insights that might impact capital expenditures.\n     - Look at **Earnings Call Transcripts** for management commentary on capital spending and business strategy.\n\n4. **Analyze the Data**:\n   - Calculate the capital intensity ratio by comparing Capital Expenditures to Total Revenue for FY 2022.\n   - Consider the trend of capital expenditures over the past few years to see if there is a consistent pattern.\n\n5. **Draw Conclusions**:\n   - Based on the analysis, does Verizon exhibit characteristics of a capital-intensive business? What insights can be derived from the data regarding its investment in physical assets relative to its revenue generation?\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically evaluate whether Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on FY 2022 data.",
