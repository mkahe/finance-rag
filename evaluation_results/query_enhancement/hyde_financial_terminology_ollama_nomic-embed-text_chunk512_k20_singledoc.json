    "expanded_query": "Based on the financial data for the fiscal year 2022, 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) can indeed be classified as a capital-intensive business. This determination is supported by several key financial metrics and operational characteristics.\n\nIn FY2022, 3M reported capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion, representing a significant investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) relative to its revenue base of $35.4 billion. This investment underscores the company\u2019s commitment to maintaining and enhancing its manufacturing capabilities across its diversified product segments, including Safety & Industrial, Transportation & Electronics, and Health Care.\n\nThe capital expenditure to revenue ratio for 3M in FY2022 was approximately 4.8%, which is indicative of a substantial commitment to capital investment. This ratio exceeds the industry average for diversified industrial companies, suggesting that 3M allocates a higher proportion of its resources toward maintaining and expanding its physical asset base.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s depreciation and amortization expense totaled approximately $1.5 billion for the year, reflecting the wear and tear on its extensive capital assets. The relatively high level of capital investments and associated depreciation aligns with the characteristics of a capital-intensive business model, where significant resources are required to sustain operational efficiency and product innovation.\n\nFurthermore, 3M\u2019s strategic initiatives in advancing manufacturing technologies and optimizing supply chain efficiencies necessitate ongoing capital investments. The company\u2019s focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship also drives additional capital expenditures, particularly in upgrading facilities to meet regulatory standards and consumer expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, the fiscal year 2022 data clearly indicates that 3M operates as a capital-intensive business, as evidenced by its substantial capital expenditures, high capital expenditure to revenue ratio, and significant ongoing investments in PP&E to support its long-term growth objectives.",

    "expanded_query": "In FY2022, 3M Company experienced a notable change in its operating margin, which was primarily driven by a combination of factors including fluctuations in raw material costs, changes in product mix, and operational efficiencies achieved through our continuous improvement initiatives.\n\nSpecifically, the gross margin contracted by approximately 150 basis points, reflecting the significant increase in input costs, particularly in the commodities sector, which impacted our cost of goods sold. Despite these challenges, we implemented robust pricing strategies across several business segments, which partially offset the margin compression.\n\nAdditionally, the diversification of our product portfolio, particularly in higher-margin segments such as Health Care and Electronics, contributed positively to the operating margin. The integration of advanced manufacturing technologies further enhanced our operational efficiencies, allowing us to optimize production processes and reduce overhead costs.\n\nIt is important to note that while operating margin is a relevant metric for assessing our operational performance, it should be viewed in conjunction with other financial metrics such as EBITDA margin and net income margin to provide a comprehensive picture of our overall profitability. The nature of our business, which involves a diverse range of products and markets, can lead to variability in operating margin that may not fully capture the underlying financial health of the organization.\n\nIn summary, while the operating margin provides insight into our operational efficiency, it is essential to consider it alongside broader financial indicators to accurately assess 3M's financial performance for FY2022 and beyond.",

Consequently, this segment's organic sales growth was negatively affected, reflecting a year-over-year decline of approximately 5%. \n\nIn contrast, our Industrial and Safety segments showed resilience, posting positive organic growth rates of 3% and 4%, respectively. However, the underperformance in Health Care, particularly in our infection prevention and surgical solutions product lines, was sufficient to mitigate the overall sales momentum across the enterprise.\n\nAs we look ahead, we remain committed to driving innovation and operational efficiencies within the Health Care segment to reposition it for sustainable growth. We believe that our strategic initiatives, including enhanced product offerings and improved customer engagement, will enable us to recover lost ground and contribute positively to our long-term financial objectives.",

The quick ratio, which is calculated by dividing the sum of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable by current liabilities, serves as a critical measure of our ability to meet short-term obligations without relying on inventory liquidation. \n\nThis ratio reflects 3M's commitment to maintaining a robust working capital structure, ensuring that we can effectively manage our operational cash flows and fulfill our short-term liabilities. A quick ratio above 1.0 suggests that we have sufficient liquid assets to cover our current liabilities, thereby reducing the risk of liquidity constraints.\n\nIt is important to note that while the quick ratio provides significant insights into liquidity, it should be considered alongside other financial metrics, including the current ratio and cash flow from operations. The current ratio, which incorporates inventory into the liquidity assessment, may provide a broader perspective on our overall financial health, especially given the nature of our diverse product portfolio and the cyclical dynamics inherent in our industry.\n\nIn conclusion, the quick ratio for Q2 FY2023 reinforces our liquidity position and reflects our strategic focus on financial discipline and operational efficiency. We remain vigilant in monitoring our liquidity and will continue to prioritize measures that enhance our financial stability and resilience in the face of evolving market conditions.",

Over the past decade, the company has maintained an uninterrupted dividend payout, reflecting a robust dividend policy that aligns with its long-term growth strategy.\n\nIn the most recent fiscal year, 3M's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, representing an annualized dividend of $5.92 per share. This reflects a year-over-year increase of approximately 1.5%, underscoring our dedication to maintaining a reliable dividend stream despite macroeconomic challenges and fluctuations in market conditions.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to sustain its dividend payments is supported by strong operating cash flow, which for the last fiscal year was reported at $5.4 billion. Our payout ratio remains within a prudent range, currently at 58%, allowing for reinvestment in strategic growth initiatives while providing a competitive yield for our shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, 3M\u2019s long-standing history of dividend increases positions the company as a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its dividend for over 60 consecutive years. This track record not only reflects our financial resilience but also our consistent focus on shareholder returns as a core element of our capital allocation strategy.\n\nMoving forward, 3M is committed to maintaining its dividend distribution policy while balancing the need for strategic investments in innovation and sustainability. We remain optimistic about our financial outlook and are confident in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through both dividends and capital appreciation.",

Round your answer to two decimal places. Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.",
    "expanded_query": "For the fiscal year 2019, Activision Blizzard reported total revenue of $6.49 billion. To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, we first need to determine the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between fiscal years 2018 and 2019.\n\nAccording to the consolidated statements of financial position, Activision Blizzard reported net PP&E of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2018, and $1.45 billion as of December 31, 2019. The average PP&E for the period can be calculated as follows:\n\nAverage PP&E = (PP&E FY2018 + PP&E FY2019) / 2  \nAverage PP&E = ($1.35 billion + $1.45 billion) / 2  \nAverage PP&E = $1.40 billion\n\nSubsequently, we can compute the fixed asset turnover ratio using the formula provided:\n\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average PP&E  \nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $6.49 billion / $1.40 billion  \nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = 4.64\n\nTherefore, the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard for the fiscal year 2019 is 4.64, reflecting the company's ability to efficiently utilize its fixed assets to generate revenue. This metric indicates a robust operational efficiency and effective asset management strategy during the fiscal year.",

This results in a capex-to-revenue ratio of approximately 6.5%. \n\nIn FY2018, revenue increased to $7.50 billion, while capital expenditures rose to $510 million, yielding a capex-to-revenue ratio of roughly 6.8%. \n\nFor FY2019, the company reported total revenue of $6.49 billion, with capital expenditures of $482 million, which translates to a capex-to-revenue ratio of about 7.4%.\n\nCalculating the three-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue:\n\n- FY2017: 6.5%\n- FY2018: 6.8%\n- FY2019: 7.4%\n\nThe three-year average comes to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Capex %} = \\frac{6.5 + 6.8 + 7.4}{3} = \\frac{20.7}{3} = 6.9\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the three-year average of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is approximately **6.9%**.

Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "expanded_query": "As part of our financial analysis for fiscal year 2015, we calculated the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe Inc. The operating cash flow ratio serves as a key liquidity metric, indicating the company\u2019s ability to cover its current liabilities with cash generated from operating activities.\n\nAccording to the statement of financial position, Adobe reported total current liabilities of $1.4 billion as of the end of FY2015. In the cash flow statement, the net cash provided by operating activities for the same fiscal year was $1.1 billion. \n\nTo compute the operating cash flow ratio, we utilize the following formula:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Cash from Operations / Total Current Liabilities\n\nSubstituting in the values from our financial statements:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $1.1 billion / $1.4 billion = 0.7857\n\nRounding this value to two decimal places, the operating cash flow ratio for Adobe Inc. for FY2015 is 0.79.\n\nThis ratio indicates that Adobe was able to cover approximately 79% of its current liabilities with cash generated from operations, reflecting a strong liquidity position and operational efficiency during the fiscal year.",

    "expanded_query": "In accordance with the principles of financial reporting and analysis, we have examined Adobe Inc.'s consolidated income statement for the fiscal years ended November 27, 2015, and November 25, 2016. \n\nFor FY2015, Adobe reported an operating income of $1.5 billion, which reflects a robust performance driven by strong demand for its Creative Cloud suite and digital marketing solutions. In FY2016, the company experienced significant growth, culminating in an operating income of $1.8 billion, attributable to the successful execution of its subscription-based model and continuous innovation in its product offerings.\n\nTo calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income, we can utilize the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Year-over-Year Change (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Operating Income FY2016} - \\text{Operating Income FY2015}}{\\text{Operating Income FY2015}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Year-over-Year Change (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{1.8 \\, \\text{billion} - 1.5 \\, \\text{billion}}{1.5 \\, \\text{billion}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\left( \\frac{0.3 \\, \\text{billion}}{1.5 \\, \\text{billion}} \\right) \\times 100 = 20.0\\%\n\\]\n\nAs such, Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is an increase of **20.0%**. This substantial growth underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value through strategic investments in technology and customer engagement, positioning Adobe favorably in an increasingly competitive landscape.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating Adobe's liquidity position for the fiscal year 2017, we calculated the operating cash flow ratio, which serves as a critical indicator of the company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash generated from operating activities. \n\nFor FY2017, Adobe reported cash flows from operating activities amounting to $3.2 billion, as detailed in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Concurrently, the total current liabilities, as reflected in our balance sheet, were reported at $1.5 billion.\n\nTo compute the operating cash flow ratio, we utilize the formula:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Cash from Operations / Total Current Liabilities\n\nSubstituting in our figures:\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = $3.2 billion / $1.5 billion = 2.13\n\nThus, rounding to two decimal places, Adobe's operating cash flow ratio for FY2017 is 2.13. This ratio indicates a robust liquidity position, suggesting that the company generated more than twice its current liabilities in operating cash flow, thereby reinforcing our capacity to meet short-term obligations and invest in growth opportunities.",

    "expanded_query": "As of fiscal year 2022, Adobe Inc. reported a notable enhancement in its operating margin profile, driven primarily by robust revenue growth and disciplined expense management. The company achieved an operating margin of 40.5%, an increase from 38.7% in the prior fiscal year. This improvement can be attributed to the continued expansion of our subscription-based business model, which has allowed for greater scalability and cost efficiencies.\n\nFurthermore, our investment in product innovation and cloud services has contributed to a higher average revenue per user (ARPU), positively impacting our overall profitability. We have also implemented strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing our operational expenditures, resulting in a lower growth rate of operating expenses relative to revenue growth.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider that while operating margin is a relevant metric for evaluating Adobe's profitability, it may not fully encapsulate the company's financial health in the context of its business model. Given that Adobe operates predominantly on a subscription basis, metrics such as Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) are increasingly critical for assessing long-term value creation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the operating margin demonstrates an improving trend, stakeholders should also analyze complementary metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of Adobe's financial performance and market position in the rapidly evolving digital media landscape.",

For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, we reported free cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion, translating to a free cash flow conversion rate of 120% relative to our net income of $4.6 billion. This represents a significant increase from the prior fiscal year, driven by a combination of strong revenue growth, effective cost management strategies, and a focused approach to working capital optimization.\n\nOur free cash flow improvement is indicative of our ability to generate substantial cash from our core operating activities, which we attribute to robust demand for our digital media and experience cloud offerings. Furthermore, the enhanced conversion rate has empowered us to reinvest in strategic initiatives, return value to shareholders through share repurchases, and maintain a healthy balance sheet.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain optimistic about sustaining this positive trend in free cash flow conversion, as we continue to leverage our innovative product portfolio and capitalize on growth opportunities in the digital transformation space. We believe that our strong free cash flow generation capabilities will position Adobe favorably to navigate potential market fluctuations and invest in future growth avenues.",

    "expanded_query": "As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of AES Corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the company reported restructuring costs amounting to $15 million, which are included in the operating expenses section of the income statement. These costs were primarily associated with the company's strategic initiative to streamline operations and enhance efficiency across its global portfolio. The restructuring expenses consist of severance payments, contract termination costs, and other related costs incurred during the reorganization process. Notably, these costs were recognized in accordance with ASC 420, \"Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations,\" and were reflective of the company's commitment to optimizing its operational framework. As such, the impact of these restructuring activities is expected to yield long-term operational efficiencies and cost savings that align with AES's strategic objectives.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2022, AES Corporation achieved an inventory turnover ratio of approximately 4.5 times. This ratio was calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the year, which amounted to $1.8 billion, by the average inventory balance of $400 million during the same period. \n\nThe inventory turnover ratio is a critical metric that reflects the efficiency of our inventory management and our ability to translate inventory into sales. A ratio of 4.5 indicates that AES Corporation sold and replaced its inventory approximately 4.5 times within the fiscal year, suggesting a robust demand for our energy solutions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that conventional inventory management practices may not be entirely meaningful for AES Corporation due to the nature of our business operations. As a leading global power company, our inventory primarily consists of materials and supplies related to the construction and maintenance of energy generation facilities, which can vary significantly due to project timelines and the long-term nature of our contracts. Therefore, while the inventory turnover ratio provides insights into our operational efficiency, it is essential to consider the unique characteristics of our industry when evaluating this metric.\n\nIn conclusion, while our inventory turnover ratio for FY2022 stands at 4.5, we recommend analyzing this figure alongside other performance indicators, such as project backlog and revenue growth, to gain a comprehensive view of AES Corporation's operational effectiveness and financial health.",

For FY2022, AES reported a net income of $500 million. To determine the average total assets, we utilized the total assets reported as of December 31, 2021, which were $10 billion, and the total assets as of December 31, 2022, amounting to $12 billion. \n\nThe average total assets for FY2022 were computed as follows:\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Total Assets FY2021 + Total Assets FY2022) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = ($10 billion + $12 billion) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = $11 billion\n\nUsing the ROA formula:\n\nROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets  \nROA = $500 million / $11 billion  \nROA = 0.0455, or 4.55%\n\nRounded to two decimal places, AES's return on assets for FY2022 is 4.55%.

Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.",
    "expanded_query": "In accordance with our evaluation of liquidity metrics, we calculated Amazon's Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for the fiscal year 2017, utilizing data derived from our consolidated financial statements. DPO provides insight into the average number of days the company takes to pay its suppliers, which is critical for understanding cash flow management.\n\nFor FY2017, the average accounts payable balance was derived from the accounts payable reported as of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017. The accounts payable figures for these periods were $16.6 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively. Consequently, the average accounts payable for the year amounted to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Payable} = \\frac{(16.6 + 21.2)}{2} = 18.9 \\, \\text{billion}\n\\]\n\nIn our calculation of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), we recorded a total of $126.0 billion for FY2017. Additionally, we noted that the change in inventory from FY2016 to FY2017 was an increase of $3.2 billion, bringing the adjusted COGS to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Adjusted COGS} = COGS + \\Delta \\text{Inventory} = 126.0 + 3.2 = 129.2 \\, \\text{billion}\n\\]\n\nUtilizing these figures, we computed the DPO as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{DPO} = 365 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Average Accounts Payable}}{\\text{Adjusted COGS}} \\right) \n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values we calculated yields:\n\n\\[\n\\text{DPO} = 365 \\times \\left( \\frac{18.9 \\, \\text{billion}}{129.2 \\, \\text{billion}} \\right) \\approx 52.85 \\, \\text{days}\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we conclude that Amazon's Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for FY2017 was approximately **52.85 days**. This metric reflects our strategic approach to managing supplier relationships and working capital, enabling us to optimize cash flow while continuing to invest in growth initiatives.",

For the fiscal year 2016, Amazon reported total net sales of $136.0 billion, whereas, for the fiscal year 2017, net sales increased to $177.9 billion. \n\nTo calculate the year-over-year change in revenue, we utilize the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Year-over-Year Change in Revenue (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}_{FY2017} - \\text{Revenue}_{FY2016}}{\\text{Revenue}_{FY2016}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Year-over-Year Change in Revenue (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{177.9 \\, \\text{billion} - 136.0 \\, \\text{billion}}{136.0 \\, \\text{billion}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating the change:\n\n\\[\n= \\left( \\frac{41.9 \\, \\text{billion}}{136.0 \\, \\text{billion}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 30.8\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the year-over-year change in revenue from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 is approximately **30.8%**. This robust growth reflects Amazon's continued expansion in various segments, including e-commerce and AWS, underscoring our commitment to enhancing customer experiences and operational efficiency.",

    "expanded_query": "Based on the analysis of Amazon's consolidated income statement for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the net income attributable to shareholders is reported as $11,588 million. This figure reflects the company's robust operational performance driven by a significant increase in net sales, which reached $280,522 million, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 20%. \n\nThe net income was further bolstered by a decrease in the effective tax rate, which contributed positively to the bottom line. Additionally, the company experienced a notable improvement in operating income, which amounted to $14,541 million, underscoring Amazon's ability to leverage its economies of scale and enhance profitability across its various segments, including North America and International.\n\nThe diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to common shareholders for FY2019 was reported at $23.01, compared to $20.14 in FY2018, indicating a favorable earnings trajectory. This consistent growth in net income reflects Amazon's strategic investments in technology, logistics, and its expanding ecosystem, all of which are expected to drive future profitability and shareholder value creation.\n\nIn summary, the net income attributable to shareholders for Amazon in FY2019 stands at $11,588 million, demonstrating a solid financial performance amidst a competitive landscape.",

This figure reflects the total accounts receivable less any allowances for doubtful accounts, which amounted to $50 million for the year. The net AR figure is indicative of Amcor\u2019s strong revenue collection processes and efficient management of trade receivables. The increase in net accounts receivable over the previous fiscal year can be attributed to heightened sales activity as a result of robust demand across our packaging segments, coupled with an extension of credit terms to select customers in key markets. This strategy, while slightly increasing the risk of collectability, is aligned with our operational growth initiatives aimed at capturing market share in a competitive landscape. Overall, the net accounts receivable balance represents approximately 15% of total current assets, underscoring its significance in Amcor's liquidity position and working capital management.",

The primary agenda of this filing was to disclose the completion of its strategic acquisition of a leading flexible packaging company, which is anticipated to enhance Amcor's market share and drive revenue growth in the North American region.\n\nThe acquisition was executed with a total consideration valued at approximately $500 million, financed through a combination of cash on hand and existing credit facilities. This transaction aligns with Amcor\u2019s long-term growth strategy to expand its product portfolio and leverage operational synergies.\n\nAdditionally, the filing included updated guidance for the fiscal year, reflecting the anticipated impact of the acquisition on Amcor's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The company projected a modest increase in consolidated revenue driven by both organic growth and the contribution from the newly acquired business.\n\nFurthermore, the filing addressed potential risks associated with the integration process, outlining management's approach to mitigate operational disruptions and ensure a seamless transition. The Board of Directors expressed confidence in the strategic fit of the acquisition and its potential to deliver sustainable shareholder value.\n\nThis 8-K filing is part of Amcor\u2019s commitment to maintain transparency and provide timely updates to its investors regarding material events that may impact the company's financial position and operational capabilities.",

    "expanded_query": "In assessing AMCOR's liquidity position, we note that the quick ratio, a key indicator of short-term financial health, has experienced a modest improvement from FY2022 to FY2023. For FY2022, the quick ratio stood at 0.85, reflecting a challenging liquidity position amidst prevailing market conditions and supply chain disruptions. However, by the end of FY2023, this metric increased to 0.92, signaling enhanced liquidity management and a strategic reduction in inventory levels.\n\nThis improvement can be attributed to several factors, including more efficient operational practices, a deliberate focus on cash flow optimization, and an increase in receivables collection efficiency. The rise in the quick ratio indicates that AMCOR is better positioned to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, a crucial consideration for stakeholders and analysts alike, especially in the context of potential economic fluctuations.\n\nWhile the quick ratio is typically more relevant for companies with significant inventory levels, it remains a pertinent measure for AMCOR given its operational focus on packaging solutions, which can fluctuate based on market demands. This liquidity measure provides investors with insight into the company's capability to handle unforeseen financial pressures without relying on inventory liquidation, thus reinforcing confidence in AMCOR's financial stability and operational resilience.",

    "expanded_query": "In the fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, Amcor plc has strategically pursued acquisitions to enhance its market positioning and expand its product portfolio within the packaging industry. \n\nIn FY2023, Amcor successfully completed the acquisition of **Flexibles Division of Packaging Corporation**, a move that significantly bolstered our capabilities in sustainable flexible packaging solutions. This acquisition aligns with our growth strategy to capitalize on the increasing demand for environmentally-friendly packaging options. The transaction, valued at approximately **$500 million**, is expected to be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) by the second fiscal year post-acquisition.\n\nIn FY2022, we acquired **Tetra Pak's Flexible Packaging Business**, which allowed us to expand our presence in the North American market. This acquisition, valued at **$400 million**, has enhanced our product offerings in the food and beverage sector, providing us with advanced technology and a robust client base. The integration of Tetra Pak\u2019s assets has already begun to yield operational synergies, contributing positively to our revenue growth trajectory.\n\nIn FY2021, Amcor strategically acquired **Bemis Company, Inc.**, a pivotal transaction valued at **$6.8 billion**. This merger created one of the largest packaging companies globally, allowing us to leverage Bemis\u2019s extensive portfolio and distribution network. The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and debt issuance, and it has resulted in cost synergies estimated at **$200 million** annually, enhancing our overall operational efficiency.\n\nThese acquisitions reflect Amcor\u2019s commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the packaging industry through strategic growth initiatives, and we remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value while adhering to our sustainability goals.",

    "expanded_query": "As of the fiscal year 2023, AMCOR has demonstrated a positive trajectory in its gross margin profile, reflecting an upward trend driven by strategic initiatives aimed at operational efficiency and cost management. The gross margin for FY2023 improved to 25.4%, compared to 23.8% in the prior fiscal year. This enhancement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a favorable product mix, increased pricing power amid rising raw material costs, and the successful implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies that have streamlined production processes.\n\nHowever, it is essential to contextualize the relevance of gross margin within the broader operational framework of AMCOR. Given the company's focus on diversified packaging solutions and its extensive global supply chain, gross margin may not fully encapsulate the company's financial health. Instead, metrics such as EBITDA margin, operating income, and free cash flow generation may provide a more comprehensive view of AMCOR\u2019s profitability and operational efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, the cyclical nature of raw material pricing and the complexities of the packaging industry necessitate a nuanced approach to assessing profitability. While gross margin serves as an indicator of product profitability, it does not account for the substantial investments in technology, sustainability initiatives, and strategic acquisitions that AMCOR has undertaken to position itself for long-term growth. Therefore, while the improvement in gross margin is a positive signal, stakeholders should consider a holistic analysis of the company's performance across multiple financial metrics to gauge its overall health and strategic direction.",

This liability is primarily composed of severance and termination benefits, contract termination costs, and associated legal and professional fees incurred in connection with our restructuring efforts.\n\nThe purpose of this restructuring initiative is to enhance operational efficiency, streamline our product offerings, and ultimately drive sustainable profitability across our global operations. The restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings that will contribute to improved cash flows and shareholder value in the long term.\n\nAs reported, the restructuring liability amounts to approximately $XX million, representing management's best estimate of the costs that will be incurred through the execution of the plan. The recognized liability is recorded in accordance with ASC 420, \"Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations,\" and will be adjusted as necessary to reflect changes in estimates or additional costs identified as the restructuring plan is implemented.\n\nWe anticipate that the majority of the restructuring expenditures will be settled by the end of FY2024, aligning with our commitment to return to operational excellence and fiscal responsibility. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of these restructuring activities in future filings and earnings calls, as transparency remains a critical component of our communication with stakeholders.",

    "expanded_query": "For the fiscal year 2023, Amcor reported an Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA of $1.25 billion, reflecting a strong operational performance and disciplined cost management across our global manufacturing footprint. This figure represents an increase of approximately 8% compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by enhanced production efficiencies and strategic pricing initiatives. \n\nIn accordance with our non-GAAP financial measures, the Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. These adjustments include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses, and non-recurring legal costs, which totaled approximately $150 million for the year. \n\nThis robust Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA underscores our commitment to delivering sustainable value to our shareholders while navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain focused on leveraging our innovative packaging solutions to drive revenue growth and improve margins as we move forward into FY 2024.",

This increase reflects the underlying growth in our core business operations, driven by strong demand across key segments, particularly in flexible packaging and specialty cartons. \n\nExcluding the adverse effects of currency translation, which reduced our reported sales growth by approximately 2.1%, and accounting for passthrough costs related to raw material price fluctuations\u2014estimated at 3.5%\u2014we are pleased to highlight that the underlying volume and price mix contributed positively to our revenue performance. Furthermore, by isolating the impact of one-off items, which included non-recurring gains from asset sales, we are able to present a clearer picture of our operational efficiency and sustained demand trends.\n\nOverall, the real growth in sales underscores our strategic initiatives to enhance product offerings and expand into emerging markets, positioning Amcor for continued robust performance in the upcoming fiscal period.",

    "query": "Answer the following question as if you are an equity research analyst and have lost internet connection so you do not have access to financial metric providers. According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?",
    "expanded_query": "In analyzing Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) for the fiscal year 2015, we can derive the depreciation and amortization (D&A) percentage margin by referencing the details provided in the consolidated statement of operations (P&L statement) and the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nFor FY2015, AMD reported total revenue of approximately $4.0 billion. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the D&A expense was noted to be around $400 million. To calculate the D&A percentage margin, we utilize the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{D&A Percentage Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{D&A}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the figures:\n\n\\[ \\text{D&A Percentage Margin} = \\left( \\frac{400,000,000}{4,000,000,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, AMD's depreciation and amortization percentage margin for FY2015 stands at 10%. This metric indicates the proportion of revenue that is allocated to D&A, reflecting the company's investment in capital assets and the aging of its tangible and intangible assets. It is essential to monitor this ratio over time to assess how effectively AMD is managing its capital expenditures relative to its revenue growth.",

    "expanded_query": "In assessing Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (AMD) liquidity profile for the fiscal year 2022, we examined the company's quick ratio, which is a critical indicator of short-term financial health. The quick ratio is calculated by taking current assets, excluding inventories, and dividing by current liabilities. This metric provides insight into AMD's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nFor FY22, AMD reported current assets totaling $6.5 billion, of which $5.2 billion was comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. The company's total current liabilities stood at $4.4 billion. Consequently, the quick ratio is computed as follows:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities  \nQuick Ratio = ($6.5 billion - $0) / $4.4 billion = 1.48\n\nWith a quick ratio of 1.48, AMD demonstrates a solid liquidity position, indicating that the company has $1.48 in liquid assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities. This suggests that AMD is well-positioned to cover its short-term obligations, reflecting a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the quick ratio is a valuable measure, it may not fully capture AMD's liquidity status in certain contexts. Given the nature of the semiconductor industry, where inventory turnover can be rapid and predictable, some analysts may argue that the current ratio\u2014which includes inventory\u2014provides a more comprehensive view of liquidity. Thus, while the quick ratio indicates robust short-term liquidity, stakeholders should also consider the broader context of AMD\u2019s operational efficiency and inventory management practices when evaluating liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the quick ratio analysis, AMD exhibits a favorable liquidity profile for FY22, but it is advisable for investors to consider additional financial metrics and qualitative factors when assessing the company's overall financial health.",

(AMD) experienced a significant revenue increase, driven primarily by robust demand across our Computing and Graphics segment, which saw a year-over-year growth of 45%. This was largely attributable to the successful launch of our next-generation Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards, which captured substantial market share in both consumer and enterprise sectors. \n\nAdditionally, our Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment contributed positively, with a revenue increase of 30%, fueled by strong performance in data center solutions and an uptick in demand for gaming consoles powered by our semi-custom chips. \n\nFurthermore, we noted that our strategic partnerships with cloud service providers and the expansion of our data center offerings have enhanced our competitive positioning, driving incremental revenue from high-performance computing applications. \n\nWe also experienced favorable pricing dynamics, reflecting the value proposition of our advanced semiconductor technology and the ongoing supply-demand imbalance in the industry. \n\nOverall, our diversified product portfolio and strategic initiatives positioned us well to capitalize on the growing trends in AI, machine learning, and gaming, resulting in total revenue of $23.6 billion for FY22, representing a 45% increase compared to FY21. \n\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to investing in R&D to sustain our innovation pipeline and drive long-term growth.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2022, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (\"AMD\" or the \"Company\") experienced a notable shift in operating margin, primarily driven by several key factors that influenced both revenue and operating expenses.\n\nFirstly, revenue growth was fueled by robust demand across our key product segments, particularly in the Data Center and Gaming divisions. Our strategic investments in high-performance computing and graphics solutions have resulted in increased market share and expanded customer adoption, contributing to an increase in net sales. Notably, the launch of our next-generation processors and GPUs has positioned us competitively within the semiconductor industry, enabling us to capture higher pricing power in select markets.\n\nHowever, operating margin was also impacted by escalating costs associated with supply chain disruptions and increased raw material prices, which are reflective of broader industry trends. These factors have necessitated adjustments in our cost structure, including higher manufacturing and logistics expenses, which in turn exerted downward pressure on our operating margin.\n\nAdditionally, increased investment in research and development (R&D) was a strategic imperative to sustain our competitive edge and drive future innovation. While this investment is expected to yield long-term benefits, it contributed to a temporary compression of operating margins in the current fiscal year.\n\nIt is important to note that while operating margin is a commonly used financial metric, its relevance may vary for a company like AMD, which operates in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the substantial capital expenditures required for R&D and manufacturing can render operating margin a less comprehensive indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. Consequently, we believe that metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow may provide a more holistic view of our performance and financial stability, as they account for both operational efficiencies and the impact of our growth investments.\n\nIn summary, while we experienced fluctuations in operating margin during FY22, primarily due to revenue growth, cost pressures, and strategic investments, we remain focused on long-term value creation and are committed to executing our growth strategy effectively.",

Notably, the cash flow generated from operating activities significantly outpaced our investing and financing activities. \n\nFor FY22, AMD reported net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $3.5 billion, driven primarily by strong revenue growth and efficient working capital management. The increase in cash flow was attributable to a year-over-year rise in sales, particularly in our high-performance computing and graphics segments, alongside effective cost containment measures that enhanced our operating margins.\n\nConversely, cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting our investment in capital expenditures aimed at expanding our manufacturing capabilities and R&D initiatives to sustain our competitive edge in the semiconductor market. \n\nOn the financing side, we reported net cash used in financing activities of around $600 million, which included share repurchases and dividend payments to our shareholders. This strategic allocation of capital underscores our commitment to returning value to our shareholders while maintaining a solid balance sheet.\n\nIn summary, the strongest contributor to our cash flow for FY22 was our operating activities, which not only provided the most cash inflow but also reinforced our operational resilience in a competitive landscape. This positive cash flow from operations allowed us to fund our strategic investments and support our financing activities effectively.",

This performance underscores our commitment to innovation and our ability to respond to evolving market demands effectively.\n\nAs we move forward, we remain optimistic about sustaining this momentum in the Client segment and anticipate continued growth through targeted investments in R&D and strategic partnerships.

(AMD) experienced a moderate level of customer concentration, which is reflective of the competitive landscape within the semiconductor industry. As disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized that a significant portion of our revenue was derived from a limited number of major customers. Specifically, our top five customers accounted for approximately 60% of total revenue, with our largest customer contributing around 25% of total sales.\n\nThis customer concentration poses inherent risks, including potential fluctuations in demand from these key clients and the impact of their purchasing decisions on our overall financial performance. We continue to engage in strategic initiatives to diversify our customer base and mitigate reliance on any single customer. Additionally, we have implemented comprehensive risk management practices to monitor dependency levels and to ensure sustained operational resilience.\n\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to expanding our market presence across various sectors, including data centers, gaming, and embedded solutions, which we believe will further dilute customer concentration risks and enhance our revenue stability in the long term.",

    "expanded_query": "As of the end of fiscal year 2022, American Express Company (AMEX) has demonstrated a positive trajectory in its operating margin profile, reflecting a strategic focus on enhancing operational efficiency and optimizing revenue streams. The operating margin for the year improved to 24.5%, up from 22.1% in 2021. This increase can be attributed to robust growth in both cardholder spending and transaction volumes, which have driven higher net revenues, coupled with disciplined expense management across the organization.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the operating margin provides valuable insights into AMEX's operational efficiency, it may not be the most comprehensive metric for assessing the company's overall financial health. Given that AMEX operates within the financial services industry, where revenue is significantly influenced by factors such as customer acquisition costs, payment processing fees, and the cyclical nature of consumer spending, reliance solely on operating margin could overlook critical elements of its business model.\n\nFor a company like AMEX, metrics such as Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), and net interest yield may provide a more holistic view of performance, as they account for the unique dynamics of the credit card and financial services sector. Furthermore, the company's ability to generate sustainable earnings growth and manage credit risk is paramount, which is reflected in our ongoing investments in technology and customer engagement initiatives.\n\nIn summary, while AMEX's operating margin has indeed improved in 2022, stakeholders should consider a multifaceted approach to financial analysis that encompasses various performance metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's operational effectiveness and market position.",

    "expanded_query": "In FY2022, American Express experienced a notable shift in its gross margin, primarily driven by several interrelated factors. It is important to note that while gross margin is a conventional metric used for many companies, its utility in evaluating American Express's performance is somewhat limited due to the nature of its business model, which operates on a fee-based revenue structure rather than traditional product sales.\n\nFor the fiscal year, the gross margin percentage reflected a decline from the previous year, largely attributed to increased operational costs and investments in technology and marketing initiatives aimed at expanding our customer base and enhancing the overall customer experience. Specifically, we witnessed a rise in card member rewards expenses, which are directly correlated with higher spending by our card members, leading to increased incentive payouts. Additionally, we incurred elevated costs associated with our ongoing digital transformation, including investments in cybersecurity and payment processing infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, the competitive landscape in the financial services sector necessitated strategic pricing adjustments, which, while aimed at enhancing customer acquisition and retention, exerted downward pressure on our effective fee income margin. This was further compounded by macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures impacting our overall cost structure.\n\nGiven that American Express primarily generates revenue through discount fees, annual fees, and interest income, the more relevant metrics for assessing our profitability and operational efficiency would be operating margin and return on equity (ROE). These metrics provide a clearer picture of our financial performance and strategic positioning within the market. As we continue to invest in growth initiatives while managing our cost structure, we remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value and optimizing our overall profitability profile.",

This increase of 230 basis points can be attributed to a combination of factors, including changes in the mix of taxable income, the impact of discrete tax items recognized in the prior year, and adjustments related to state taxes. \n\nMoreover, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the benefits derived from various tax credits and incentives aimed at promoting business investments. The company remains committed to optimizing its tax position while adhering to regulatory compliance, as outlined in our income tax provisions under ASC 740. Moving forward, we anticipate that our effective tax rate may continue to fluctuate based on changes in tax legislation, operational performance, and the geographic distribution of our earnings. \n\nOverall, we are confident in our ability to manage our tax obligations effectively and leverage available deductions and credits to enhance shareholder value over the long term.",

The largest component of these liabilities was the company\u2019s credit card and charge card customer deposits, which totaled approximately $45.2 billion. This figure reflects the significant role that customer deposits play in our funding strategy, as they represent a critical source of low-cost funding for our operations. \n\nAdditionally, we maintained a robust level of long-term debt, amounting to approximately $30.4 billion, which includes senior notes and other borrowings that are essential for supporting our business growth and capital investments. Our liability management strategy remains focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet while ensuring adequate liquidity to meet our obligations.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the company's total liabilities increased in comparison to the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by growth in our card member loans and an increase in accounts payable related to operational activities. This increase in liabilities is consistent with our strategic initiatives aimed at expanding our customer base and enhancing our product offerings, ultimately contributing to long-term shareholder value. \n\nIn summary, while customer deposits constituted the largest liability on our balance sheet, our overall liability structure continues to support our operational needs and financial stability as we navigate a dynamic economic environment.",

The Company reported an increase of 5% in total card member accounts, reaching 128 million by year-end, driven by strategic initiatives focused on enhancing customer engagement and loyalty programs.\n\nKey performance indicators, such as the Card Member Retention Rate (CMRR), remained strong at 87%, reflecting our commitment to providing exceptional service and value to our card members. Additionally, the average spend per card member increased by 9%, indicating not only retention but also the successful cross-selling of products and services, which contributed to a 15% rise in total revenue from card member fees.\n\nWe attribute this success to our targeted marketing campaigns, the expansion of our rewards program, and the introduction of new features tailored to meet the evolving needs of our diverse customer base. Furthermore, our continued investment in digital capabilities has enhanced the overall customer experience, fostering long-term loyalty.\n\nIn summary, our ability to retain card members in 2022 is a testament to our strategic focus on customer satisfaction and value creation, positioning American Express for sustained growth in the competitive payments landscape.",

Additionally, the cash flow statement indicated total depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $500 million for the same fiscal period. \n\nTherefore, the unadjusted EBITDA, calculated as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, amounts to approximately $1.4 billion (USD millions) for FY2021. This figure is critical for assessing the company\u2019s operational performance and cash generation potential before the effects of financing and accounting decisions.\n\nWe believe this unadjusted EBITDA provides investors with a clearer view of our core operational profitability and cash flow generation capabilities, which are essential for funding future growth initiatives and maintaining our dividend policy.",

This indicates that the Company possesses positive working capital, highlighting its ability to meet short-term obligations and fund operational needs effectively.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while working capital is a relevant metric for assessing liquidity in many industries, its utility for a regulated utility company like American Water Works may be somewhat limited. The nature of our business involves significant capital investments in infrastructure and long-term assets, which are financed through a combination of debt and equity. Consequently, the focus on working capital can sometimes obscure a more comprehensive view of financial health, particularly when considering cash flow from operations and capital expenditure requirements.\n\nIn our case, we prioritize metrics such as cash flow from operations, return on equity, and capital structure efficiency, which are more indicative of our operational performance and financial stability in the long term. Thus, while we maintain positive working capital, stakeholders are encouraged to consider a broader range of financial metrics to fully understand the Company\u2019s financial position and operational effectiveness.",

    "expanded_query": "Based on the analysis of the income statement for Best Buy for the fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the three-year average net profit margin was calculated as follows: \n\nFor FY2015, Best Buy reported a net income of $1.5 billion against total revenues of $40.3 billion, resulting in a net profit margin of approximately 3.7%. In FY2016, the company achieved a net income of $1.3 billion with total revenues of $39.5 billion, yielding a net profit margin of around 3.3%. For FY2017, the reported net income was $1.7 billion on total revenues of $42.2 billion, which translates to a net profit margin of about 4.0%. \n\nCalculating the three-year average net profit margin: \n\n(3.7% + 3.3% + 4.0%) / 3 = 3.67%, which rounds to 3.7%.\n\nThus, the three-year average net profit margin for Best Buy from FY2015 to FY2017 is 3.7%. This metric reflects the company's ability to convert revenues into profit, indicating a consistent operational efficiency during this period.",

    "expanded_query": "In reviewing Best Buy Co., Inc.'s historical gross margins, it is evident that while there has been some variation, the fluctuations have generally remained within a range of approximately 2% year-over-year. For the fiscal years ending 2020 through 2023, gross margins were recorded at 24.5%, 24.8%, 24.3%, and 24.6% respectively. These figures illustrate a degree of consistency in Best Buy's gross margin performance, which can be attributed to the company's effective inventory management strategies and its ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while gross margin is a relevant metric for evaluating operational efficiency, it may not fully encapsulate Best Buy's financial health or overall profitability. Given the company's diverse revenue streams\u2014including services provided through its Geek Squad division and recurring revenue from subscription services\u2014operating income, EBITDA, and net income might provide a more comprehensive view of financial performance. Furthermore, the retail electronics sector is subject to market dynamics, including competitive pricing pressures and shifts in consumer preferences, which can impact gross margins more than other metrics.\n\nIn conclusion, while Best Buy's gross margins have shown a level of historical consistency, stakeholders are encouraged to consider a broader set of financial indicators when assessing the company's overall performance and outlook.",

This strategic acquisition, valued at approximately $150 million, allows us to enhance our service offerings in the burgeoning smart home market, aligning with our long-term growth strategy. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings starting in FY2024 and will integrate seamlessly with our existing services portfolio.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2022:**\nIn FY2022, Best Buy acquired the assets of HomeTech Innovations, a company specializing in home automation and energy management solutions, for a total consideration of $100 million. This acquisition was aimed at bolstering our capabilities in energy-efficient technology, which is increasingly important to our customer base.

We will continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic vision and deliver sustainable growth.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2023, Best Buy Company, Inc. reported a robust performance across its cash flow activities, with significant contributions from each segment. However, upon analyzing the cash flow statements, it is evident that operating activities were the primary driver of cash inflow for the year. \n\nTotal cash provided by operating activities amounted to $1.8 billion, reflecting a 12% increase compared to fiscal year 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to improved inventory management and a reduction in operating expenses, which positively impacted our net income. Additionally, the company's continued focus on enhancing customer experience and digital transformation initiatives contributed to higher sales volumes, thereby bolstering cash generation from this segment.\n\nIn contrast, cash used in investing activities was reported at $500 million, primarily due to capital expenditures associated with store renovations, technology upgrades, and investments in supply chain efficiencies. While this represents an increase from the prior year, it aligns with our strategic objectives to drive future growth and operational efficiency.\n\nLastly, financing activities generated a net cash outflow of $600 million, primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt and the payment of dividends to shareholders. The company remains committed to returning value to its shareholders while maintaining a balanced capital structure.\n\nIn summary, operating activities were the most significant contributor to our cash flow in FY2023, underscoring the strength of our core business operations and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing profitability and cash-generating capabilities.",

Specifically, as of December 31, 2023, our Cash and Cash Equivalents stood at $150 million. However, by June 30, 2024, this figure had declined to $120 million, reflecting a decrease of $30 million, or 20%.\n\nThis reduction can primarily be attributed to several factors, including increased operational expenditures and strategic investments aimed at enhancing our growth initiatives. Notably, we have allocated additional resources towards research and development, which has resulted in elevated cash outflows. Furthermore, our ongoing capital expenditure program has necessitated the deployment of cash reserves to fund the acquisition of new assets aimed at driving future revenue growth.\n\nIt is important to highlight that, despite this decrease, our liquidity position remains robust, supported by our current line of credit and cash flow from operations. We continue to monitor our cash position closely, ensuring that we maintain adequate liquidity to meet our short-term obligations while strategically investing in long-term growth opportunities.",

As of the end of the second quarter, the total number of retail locations was 1,024, reflecting a net decrease of 30 stores compared to the 1,054 locations reported at the end of Q2 of fiscal year 2023. This reduction is part of our ongoing initiative to optimize our store portfolio and enhance operational efficiency in response to evolving consumer preferences and the increasing shift towards e-commerce. \n\nThe store closures were primarily concentrated in markets where we have identified a significant overlap in service areas and where we believe we can better serve our customers through our enhanced online platforms and delivery capabilities. We remain committed to providing accessible and convenient shopping experiences while managing our cost structure effectively. \n\nOverall, we anticipate that this adjustment will contribute positively to our long-term operational strategy, resulting in improved sales per square foot for our remaining locations and further strengthening our competitive positioning in the retail electronics market.",

    "expanded_query": "In Q2 of FY2024, Best Buy's domestic market performance revealed that the Appliances product category was the standout performer, delivering significant top-line growth. The Appliances segment experienced a robust year-over-year increase in revenue, driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for major home appliances, including refrigerators, washers, and dryers. This growth was further supported by our strategic promotional initiatives and enhanced in-store customer experience, which facilitated increased market penetration. \n\nOverall, Appliances accounted for approximately 35% of our total domestic revenue for the quarter, reflecting a notable increase from the prior year. This performance underscores our commitment to expanding our product offerings within this category and capitalizing on the ongoing trends in home improvement and renovation. Additionally, we observed an uptick in online sales within this segment, which contributed to our overall e-commerce growth strategy. \n\nAs we move forward, we remain focused on leveraging our multi-channel retail approach to sustain momentum in this category while continuing to enhance our supply chain efficiencies and customer engagement strategies.",

Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.",
    "expanded_query": "Based on the analysis of Block, Inc.'s consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2020, we observed a significant growth in total revenues. \n\nFor FY2019, Block reported total revenues of approximately $4.7 billion, while in FY2020, total revenues increased to approximately $9.5 billion. To calculate the total revenue growth rate, we applied the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}_{FY2020} - \\text{Revenue}_{FY2019}}{\\text{Revenue}_{FY2019}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{9.5 \\text{ billion} - 4.7 \\text{ billion}}{4.7 \\text{ billion}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 102.1\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the total revenue growth rate for Block, Inc. from FY2019 to FY2020 is approximately **102.1%**. This remarkable growth trajectory can be attributed to increased adoption of digital payment solutions and the expansion of the company\u2019s product offerings during the fiscal year.",

This figure represents the net cash generated from the company's core business operations, adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, as well as changes in working capital. The increase in cash flow from operating activities is attributable to robust growth in transaction volume and an expanded customer base, driven by the acceleration of digital payments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This strong performance underscores the company\u2019s ability to effectively manage operational efficiencies and capitalize on market opportunities. Additionally, the cash generated from operating activities significantly contributed to the company's liquidity position, enabling further investments in product development and strategic acquisitions.",

This growth was attributed to both the delivery of advanced military aircraft and the expansion of satellite services.\n\nIt's important to note that despite fluctuations in market conditions, both the Commercial Airplanes and Defense segments have consistently represented over 20% of our total revenue, affirming their critical role in our overall financial performance.

Specifically, Boeing is currently engaged in litigation related to the 737 MAX incidents, which includes multiple lawsuits filed by shareholders and customers alleging misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duties. \n\nAs of the reporting date, the company has recognized a contingent liability associated with these legal matters, estimating potential losses based on the probable outcomes of the litigation, taking into account the advice of legal counsel. The total estimated range of losses, which could impact future operating results, remains under review as the proceedings develop. \n\nFurthermore, Boeing is also involved in various other legal and regulatory inquiries, including those related to compliance with export regulations and contractual disputes with suppliers. While management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the company's financial condition, the uncertainty inherent in the legal process requires continuous assessment and disclosure in accordance with ASC 450, \"Contingencies.\" \n\nThe company will continue to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates on any material developments in future filings, including risks that may impact our liquidity and operational performance. \n\nOverall, Boeing remains committed to addressing these challenges while maintaining transparency with its stakeholders regarding any potential impacts on the company's financial results.",

    "expanded_query": "As of fiscal year 2022, Boeing's gross margin profile has demonstrated a modest improvement relative to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by enhanced operational efficiencies and a gradual recovery in commercial aircraft deliveries following the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The gross margin for the year was reported at 15.2%, reflecting an increase from 13.5% in FY2021. This uptick can be attributed to several factors, including cost management initiatives, favorable product mix, and increased production rates in our 737 and 787 programs.\n\nHowever, it is essential to contextualize gross margin within the broader framework of Boeing's financial performance. Given the company's significant reliance on long-term contracts and the substantial up-front costs associated with aerospace manufacturing, gross margin alone may not fully capture the profitability dynamics of the business. Instead, we also emphasize the importance of analyzing operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital (ROIC) as more comprehensive indicators of Boeing's financial health and operational efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and the lengthy sales cycle for defense contracts can introduce volatility in gross margin metrics, making them less representative of underlying business performance. Consequently, while the improvement in gross margin is a positive indicator, stakeholders are encouraged to evaluate Boeing's financial performance through a holistic lens that includes various metrics and qualitative factors impacting the company's strategic positioning and long-term growth potential.",

Notable customers in this category include Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and various international carriers, alongside leasing giants such as AerCap Holdings and Air Lease Corporation. \n\nWithin the Defense, Space & Security segment, our primary clientele consists of governmental entities, including the U.S. Department of Defense and international defense ministries, which procure military aircraft, satellites, and advanced weapon systems. Our relationships with these entities are often long-term, characterized by multi-year contracts and recurring revenue through maintenance and support services.\n\nFinally, in the Global Services segment, our customer base encompasses both commercial and government clients who rely on our aftermarket services, including maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. This segment has shown resilience and growth potential, driven by our ongoing investments in digital solutions and supply chain enhancements.\n\nOverall, our diversified customer portfolio not only mitigates risks associated with demand fluctuations in any single sector but also positions Boeing to capitalize on emerging opportunities across the aerospace and defense landscape. The dependence on key customers is closely monitored, and we strive to maintain a balanced approach to our customer relationships to ensure sustained revenue growth and stability.",

    "expanded_query": "Boeing's business is indeed subject to cyclicality, which is influenced by various macroeconomic factors that impact both commercial and defense aerospace markets. Historically, demand for commercial aircraft has shown a correlation with global economic conditions, characterized by fluctuations in air travel demand, airline profitability, and capital expenditure cycles. \n\nDuring periods of economic expansion, we typically observe an increase in airline revenues, leading to higher orders for new aircraft, which subsequently enhances our revenue streams and backlog. Conversely, in times of economic downturn, we may experience a reduction in air travel demand, resulting in deferrals or cancellations of aircraft orders, thereby exerting downward pressure on our revenue and operating margins.\n\nAdditionally, the defense segment of our business, while somewhat insulated from the commercial cyclicality, is also subject to federal budget cycles and geopolitical considerations. Changes in government spending priorities, as well as the timing of defense contract awards, can lead to variability in our defense-related revenues.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts of cyclicality, Boeing employs a diversified portfolio strategy across commercial, defense, and services segments, along with robust risk management practices. We continuously monitor market conditions and adjust our production rates and operational strategies accordingly. Overall, while cyclicality poses inherent risks, our long-term strategic initiatives aim to position us favorably for sustainable growth through various economic cycles.",

Specifically, we anticipate ramping up the production rate of the 737 MAX from its current rate of 26 units per month to 30 units per month by the end of Q3 2023. This strategic adjustment is aligned with our assessment of the commercial aviation recovery trajectory and is expected to enhance our revenue generation capacity.\n\nFurthermore, we project an incremental increase in the production rate of the 787 Dreamliner, targeting a monthly output of 5 units by Q4 2023, as supply chain constraints begin to alleviate and we achieve greater stability in our manufacturing processes. We are closely monitoring the external environment, including geopolitical factors and material availability, to ensure that these production forecasts remain achievable.\n\nAdditionally, we remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to our production planning, emphasizing quality and compliance with regulatory standards, while effectively managing our working capital and inventory levels. Our production rate adjustments are designed to optimize our operational efficiency and align with customer demand, which we believe will position Boeing favorably in the competitive landscape of the aerospace industry.\n\nWe will continue to provide updates on our production outlook and market conditions in our forthcoming quarterly earnings releases and investor communications.",

The rise in the effective tax rate can be attributed primarily to changes in the mix of earnings across various jurisdictions, coupled with the expiration of certain tax incentives that had a favorable impact on our prior year's tax position. Additionally, the company incurred increased non-deductible expenses related to ongoing restructuring efforts, which further contributed to the elevated tax rate in the current fiscal year.\n\nBoeing's tax strategy continues to focus on tax efficiency while ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects a normalization of our effective tax position as we transition from the impacts of prior year tax provisions and credits. Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing tax planning initiatives to optimize our effective tax rate in alignment with our long-term strategic objectives. \n\nAs we navigate the complexities of the global tax landscape, we remain committed to transparency and will continue to provide updates on any significant developments that may affect our tax position in future filings.",

Round your answer to two decimal places. Give a response to the question by relying on the details shown in the balance sheet and the P&L statement.",
    "expanded_query": "For the fiscal year 2017, The Coca-Cola Company reported a net income of $1.25 billion, as detailed on the consolidated statement of operations included in our Form 10-K filing. To calculate the return on assets (ROA), we first need to determine the average total assets for the period. As disclosed in the balance sheet, total assets at the end of FY2016 were $83.58 billion, and total assets at the end of FY2017 were reported at $85.34 billion.\n\nTo compute the average total assets, we utilize the formula:\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Total Assets at FY2016 + Total Assets at FY2017) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = ($83.58 billion + $85.34 billion) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = $84.46 billion\n\nSubsequently, we can calculate the ROA using the formula provided:\n\nROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets  \nROA = $1.25 billion / $84.46 billion  \nROA = 0.0148, or 1.48% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nAccordingly, the FY2017 return on assets (ROA) for The Coca-Cola Company is 1.48%, reflecting our ability to effectively utilize our asset base to generate earnings during the fiscal year. This metric is a key indicator of our operational efficiency and contributes to our overall financial performance as we strive to deliver shareholder value.",

    "expanded_query": "In response to your inquiry regarding The Coca-Cola Company's cost of goods sold (COGS) percentage margin for the fiscal year 2021, we can derive this metric using the figures reported in our consolidated income statement.\n\nFor FY2021, Coca-Cola reported total revenues of $38.66 billion. The cost of goods sold for the same period was $16.93 billion. To calculate the COGS percentage margin, we utilize the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{COGS \\% Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Total Revenues}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{COGS \\% Margin} = \\left( \\frac{16.93 \\text{ billion}}{38.66 \\text{ billion}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 43.8\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, Coca-Cola's COGS percentage margin for FY2021 was approximately 43.8%. This indicates that 43.8% of our total revenue was allocated towards the direct costs associated with the production of our beverages, reflecting our operational efficiency in managing production expenses relative to sales. \n\nThis metric is critical for assessing our cost structure and profitability, and we remain committed to optimizing our supply chain and production processes to enhance margins in future periods.",

    "expanded_query": "Based on the financial statements for the fiscal year 2022, we calculated Coca-Cola's dividend payout ratio utilizing the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders. \n\nFor FY2022, Coca-Cola reported total cash dividends paid amounting to $7.25 billion, as disclosed in the cash flow statement. Concurrently, the net income attributable to shareholders was reported at $9.77 billion in the income statement. \n\nTo determine the dividend payout ratio, we apply the following formula:\n\n**Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Cash Dividends Paid / Net Income Attributable to Shareholders) x 100**\n\nSubstituting in the figures from the financial statements:\n\n**Dividend Payout Ratio = ($7.25 billion / $9.77 billion) x 100 = 74.14%**\n\nThus, Coca-Cola's dividend payout ratio for FY2022 is approximately **74.14%**. This figure indicates a robust commitment to returning capital to shareholders, reflecting the company's ongoing strategy to maintain a consistent dividend policy while balancing reinvestment in growth opportunities.",

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "expanded_query": "Based on the financial data available in the balance sheet and the statement of income for Corning Incorporated, we calculated the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for the fiscal year 2020. \n\nTo compute DPO, we first determined the average accounts payable for the period. As reported, Corning's accounts payable for FY2019 was $1.2 billion and for FY2020 it was $1.5 billion. Thus, the average accounts payable between these two fiscal years is calculated as follows:\n\nAverage Accounts Payable = ($1.2 billion + $1.5 billion) / 2 = $1.35 billion.\n\nNext, we analyzed the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2020, which was reported at $10.0 billion. Additionally, we considered the change in inventory, where FY2019 inventory was $2.0 billion and FY2020 inventory was $2.5 billion, resulting in an increase of $0.5 billion. Consequently, the adjusted COGS, inclusive of the change in inventory, is:\n\nAdjusted COGS = COGS + Change in Inventory = $10.0 billion + $0.5 billion = $10.5 billion.\n\nNow, we can compute the DPO using the formula provided:\n\nDPO = 365 * (Average Accounts Payable) / (Adjusted COGS) \nDPO = 365 * ($1.35 billion) / ($10.5 billion) \nDPO = 365 * 0.12857142857 \nDPO \u2248 46.43 days (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nTherefore, Corning's Days Payable Outstanding for FY2020 is approximately **46.43 days**. This metric indicates the average number of days Corning takes to pay its suppliers, reflecting its liquidity management and operational efficiency in managing payables.",

    "expanded_query": "Based on the information provided in Corning's income statements for the fiscal years 2019 through 2021, we have calculated the three-year average unadjusted operating income percentage margin. \n\nFor FY2019, Corning reported total revenue of $11.5 billion and operating income of $2.3 billion, resulting in an operating income margin of approximately 20.0%. In FY2020, total revenue was $11.0 billion with operating income of $1.9 billion, yielding an operating income margin of approximately 17.3%. Finally, in FY2021, total revenue increased to $12.8 billion, with an operating income of $3.1 billion, leading to an operating income margin of approximately 24.2%. \n\nTo calculate the three-year average unadjusted operating income margin, we sum the individual operating income margins and divide by three:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Operating Income Margin} = \\frac{20.0\\% + 17.3\\% + 24.2\\%}{3} = \\frac{61.5\\%}{3} \\approx 20.5\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the three-year average unadjusted operating income margin for Corning from FY2019 to FY2021 is approximately **20.5%**.

    "expanded_query": "In reviewing the effective tax rate for Corning Incorporated, we observed a notable change between fiscal years 2021 and 2022. For FY2021, the effective tax rate was reported at 21.5%, reflecting the company's commitment to optimizing its tax liabilities amidst favorable legislative developments. However, in FY2022, the effective tax rate increased to 24.3%. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including the expiration of certain tax incentives, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, and adjustments related to the tax provisions under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the increase in the effective tax rate has been impacted by a higher proportion of earnings derived from jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, as well as the absence of one-time tax benefits that contributed to the lower effective rate in the previous fiscal year. Management is continuously evaluating tax strategies to mitigate the impact of these changes and to enhance shareholder value.\n\nWe anticipate that our effective tax rate may continue to fluctuate in future periods due to the dynamic nature of tax regulations and the ongoing assessment of our tax positions. As we move forward, we remain committed to maintaining transparency regarding our tax obligations and strategies in our SEC filings and quarterly earnings calls.",

    "expanded_query": "As of December 31, 2022, Corning Incorporated reported positive working capital, defined as current assets exceeding current liabilities. Specifically, the company\u2019s current assets amounted to $4.2 billion, while current liabilities totaled $3.5 billion, resulting in a working capital surplus of $700 million. This positive working capital position indicates that Corning possesses sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term obligations, thereby supporting operational liquidity and financial flexibility.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that while working capital is a traditional measure of liquidity, its relevance can vary across different industries. In the case of Corning, which operates in the advanced materials and technology sectors, the capital-intensive nature of our business model may render working capital a less critical metric for assessing financial health. The company's focus on long-term projects and investments in research and development can lead to fluctuations in current asset balances that may not accurately reflect operational efficiency or overall financial stability.\n\nConsequently, we encourage stakeholders to consider additional metrics such as the current ratio, cash flow from operations, and return on invested capital (ROIC) to gain a more comprehensive view of Corning's financial performance and liquidity position. By employing a broader analysis that includes these metrics, investors and analysts can better assess our capability to generate value and sustain growth in a competitive landscape.",

Round your answer to two decimal places. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the balance sheet.",
    "expanded_query": "In accordance with SEC reporting standards, we have calculated the fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health for the fiscal year 2018. The fixed asset turnover ratio is a measure of a company's efficiency in utilizing its fixed assets to generate revenue.\n\nFor FY2018, CVS Health reported total revenue of $194.58 billion. To determine the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) for the period, we took the ending balance of PP&E from FY2017, which was $34.77 billion, and the ending balance for FY2018, which was $35.20 billion. The average PP&E is calculated as follows:\n\nAverage PP&E = (PP&E FY2017 + PP&E FY2018) / 2  \nAverage PP&E = ($34.77 billion + $35.20 billion) / 2  \nAverage PP&E = $34.985 billion\n\nSubsequently, we calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio:\n\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2018 Revenue / Average PP&E  \nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $194.58 billion / $34.985 billion  \nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = 5.57\n\nThus, the fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health for the fiscal year 2018 is 5.57, indicating that the company generated approximately $5.57 in revenue for every dollar invested in fixed assets during the period. This ratio reflects our commitment to operational efficiency and effective asset management in driving revenue growth.",

For FY2022, the company reported capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, primarily allocated towards the expansion of its retail pharmacy and healthcare services infrastructure, as well as enhancements in technology systems to improve operational efficiencies.\n\nThe capital intensity of our operations is further underscored by our commitment to maintaining an extensive network of retail locations and integrated healthcare facilities, which requires ongoing investment in property, plant, and equipment. As a result, our capital expenditures represented approximately 5% of total revenue for the year, reflecting our strategic focus on long-term growth and the enhancement of patient care services.\n\nMoreover, our robust cash flow from operations, totaling $9.0 billion for FY2022, provides a solid foundation for funding these capital investments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We believe that the capital-intensive nature of our business is essential for achieving our strategic objectives, including the expansion of our health services segment and the continued investment in innovative healthcare delivery models.\n\nIn summary, the capital expenditures and investment strategies outlined in our FY2022 performance highlight CVS Health's position as a capital-intensive enterprise, dedicated to leveraging its assets to drive future growth and value creation for our shareholders.",

These matters have been disclosed in our periodic filings, including the Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022, where we outlined the potential impact of these legal proceedings on our financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have accrued liabilities related to certain ongoing legal matters, reflecting our estimate of probable losses in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies. It is important to note that while we believe we have adequate reserves, the ultimate outcomes of these matters could differ from our current estimates and may materially affect our financial condition.\n\nIn the earlier years, we reported similar litigations that stemmed from regulatory scrutiny and consumer protection claims. We continuously evaluate the status of these proceedings, and we remain committed to defending our interests vigorously. Additionally, we monitor the potential implications for our business operations and reputation, maintaining transparency with our investors regarding any developments that may arise.\n\nFor further details on these matters, please refer to the Legal Proceedings section of our most recent 10-K filing, where we provide comprehensive disclosures in compliance with SEC regulations.",

Prior to assuming the role at Foot Locker, the CEO served as Chief Executive Officer at a leading athletic footwear and apparel retailer, where they successfully implemented strategic initiatives that resulted in a significant increase in revenue and market share.\n\nDuring their tenure, the CEO was instrumental in enhancing customer engagement through innovative merchandising strategies and optimizing supply chain efficiencies, which directly contributed to improved gross margins. Additionally, the CEO's previous experience in navigating the complexities of omnichannel retailing aligns well with Foot Locker's current strategic focus on digital transformation and enhancing the customer shopping experience across both online and brick-and-mortar platforms.\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that the CEO\u2019s prior experience in scaling operations and driving profitability in a similar retail environment will be invaluable as Foot Locker continues to pursue its long-term growth objectives. The leadership transition is anticipated to facilitate the execution of the company\u2019s strategic roadmap, ultimately enhancing shareholder value.",

    "expanded_query": "In our recent shareholder meeting, we conducted a comprehensive vote regarding the slate of board member nominees put forth for election. Upon review of the voting results, it was noted that one nominee, Ms. Jane Doe, received approximately 35% of the votes against her election, significantly higher than the average dissent for other nominees, who generally received less than 5% in opposition. \n\nThis variance in voting outcomes suggests that shareholders expressed notable concerns regarding Ms. Doe's candidacy, which could be attributed to her previous involvement with companies facing regulatory scrutiny and potential governance issues. \n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency and good governance, the Board will engage in further dialogue with our shareholders to better understand their perspectives and to assess the implications of this voting outcome on our governance practices. We are dedicated to maintaining a diverse and effective board that aligns with our strategic objectives and shareholder interests.\n\nWe will also be disclosing these results in our forthcoming Form 8-K filing to ensure compliance with the SEC's reporting requirements and to keep our investors informed of significant corporate governance matters.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating General Mills, Inc.'s financial position for the fiscal year 2020, we calculated the working capital ratio by utilizing the figures reported in the statement of financial position. The working capital ratio, defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities, serves as a liquidity measure indicative of the company\u2019s ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2020, General Mills reported total current assets of $3,000 million and total current liabilities of $2,000 million. Consequently, the working capital ratio is computed as follows:\n\nWorking Capital Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities  \nWorking Capital Ratio = $3,000 million / $2,000 million  \nWorking Capital Ratio = 1.50\n\nRounded to two decimal places, General Mills's working capital ratio for FY2020 is 1.50. This ratio suggests a robust liquidity position, indicating that the company has $1.50 in current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities, thereby reflecting a solid capability to cover its short-term financial commitments. This favorable liquidity metric positions General Mills to effectively manage its operational needs and potential unforeseen financial challenges.",

The capital expenditures (capex) for the same period amounted to $600 million. Consequently, the free cash flow (FCF) for General Mills for FY2020 is calculated as follows:\n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) = Cash from Operations - Capital Expenditures  \nFCF = $1,800 million - $600 million  \nFCF = $1,200 million\n\nTherefore, General Mills generated a free cash flow of $1,200 million for FY2020, reflecting the company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital investments necessary to maintain or expand its asset base. This robust FCF generation underlines our commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining a solid balance sheet.",

    "expanded_query": "In order to calculate the fiscal year 2022 retention ratio for General Mills, we will utilize data derived from the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated statement of income. The retention ratio is a key financial metric that indicates the proportion of net income that is retained in the business, rather than distributed as dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe formula for the retention ratio can be expressed as follows:\n\n**Retention Ratio = 1 - (Total Cash Dividends Paid / Net Income Attributable to Shareholders)**\n\nFor the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, General Mills reported the following figures:\n\n- **Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:** $1.81 billion\n- **Total Cash Dividends Paid:** $1.41 billion\n\nTo compute the retention ratio, we first calculate the dividend payout ratio:\n\n**Dividend Payout Ratio = Total Cash Dividends Paid / Net Income Attributable to Shareholders**\n\nSubstituting in our values:\n\n**Dividend Payout Ratio = $1.41 billion / $1.81 billion \u2248 0.7785**\n\nNext, we derive the retention ratio:\n\n**Retention Ratio = 1 - Dividend Payout Ratio**\n\n**Retention Ratio = 1 - 0.7785 \u2248 0.2215**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the retention ratio for General Mills for FY2022 is approximately **0.22**. \n\nThis indicates that General Mills retained about 22% of its net income for reinvestment in the business, which reflects a balanced approach to capital allocation between shareholder returns and future growth opportunities.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating Johnson & Johnson's (JnJ) fiscal year 2022 financial performance, it is essential to consider several key indicators that align with high-growth company characteristics. For FY2022, JnJ reported a total revenue of $94.9 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. This growth was primarily driven by robust demand in our Pharmaceuticals segment, which alone saw an increase of 10.3%, bolstered by the successful launch of new therapies and continued strong sales of our key products.\n\nAdditionally, our net income for FY2022 reached $17.8 billion, reflecting a net profit margin of approximately 18.7%. This was achieved despite ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, demonstrating our operational resilience and ability to maintain profitability while investing in future growth initiatives. Furthermore, our earnings per share (EPS) increased to $6.83, up from $6.25 in FY2021, indicating strong earnings growth and shareholder value creation.\n\nMoreover, JnJ's commitment to innovation is evidenced by our R&D expenditures, which totaled $13.4 billion in FY2022, representing about 14.1% of revenue. This investment in research and development underscores our strategic focus on advancing our pipeline, particularly in oncology and immunology, which we anticipate will drive future revenue growth.\n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, our strong liquidity position, with a current ratio of 1.5 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.4, provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that could further enhance our growth trajectory.\n\nIn summary, while JnJ's established market presence and diversified portfolio position us as a leader in the healthcare industry, our FY2022 financials reflect significant growth dynamics that align with the attributes of a high-growth company. We remain optimistic about our strategic initiatives and market opportunities as we move into FY2023 and beyond.",

    "expanded_query": "In FY2022, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) experienced a notable shift in gross margin, which decreased to 66.5% from 68.2% in the prior fiscal year. This change can be attributed to several key factors impacting our cost structure and revenue mix.\n\nFirstly, we witnessed an increase in raw material costs across various segments, particularly in our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices divisions, driven by global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. This rise in input costs has exerted downward pressure on our gross margins, as we have been strategically focused on mitigating these impacts through operational efficiencies and cost management initiatives.\n\nSecondly, the revenue mix has shifted towards lower-margin products within our Consumer Health segment, which has also contributed to the overall decline in gross margin. As we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio in this segment, the introduction of new products, while essential for long-term growth, initially carries a different margin profile that affects our overall gross margin.\n\nFurthermore, we have undertaken significant investments in research and development, which, while not directly impacting gross margin, reflects our commitment to future growth and competitive positioning. These investments may result in short-term margin compression but are expected to yield higher-margin products in the long run.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that while gross margin is a useful metric for assessing the profitability of individual product lines, it may not fully capture the overall financial health of a diversified organization like Johnson & Johnson. Given our extensive range of business segments\u2014including Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Health\u2014other metrics such as EBITDA, operating income, and net income provide a more comprehensive view of our operational efficiency and profitability. These metrics account for the varied cost structures and strategic investments across our diverse portfolio, offering a clearer perspective on our financial performance and long-term value creation for shareholders. \n\nIn conclusion, while the gross margin has experienced fluctuations in FY2022 due to external factors and internal strategic shifts, we remain focused on driving sustainable growth through innovation and effective cost management, positioning Johnson & Johnson for continued success in the evolving healthcare landscape.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2022, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) reported a robust inventory turnover ratio of 5.4 times. This ratio was calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the year, amounting to $82.3 billion, by the average inventory for the same period, which was approximately $15.3 billion. \n\nThe inventory turnover ratio serves as a critical metric to assess the efficiency of inventory management and the company's ability to convert inventory into sales. A higher turnover ratio indicates effective inventory management and strong sales performance. In J&J's case, the ratio reflects the company's successful execution of its supply chain strategies, particularly in its Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments, which are characterized by high demand and swift inventory movement.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that conventional inventory management may not be as meaningful for J&J due to the unique nature of its business operations. As a diversified healthcare company, J&J operates across multiple segments, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Each segment has distinct inventory characteristics and turnover cycles. For instance, pharmaceuticals often involve higher-value, lower-volume inventory that may not turnover as frequently as consumer health products. Additionally, J&J's commitment to maintaining strategic inventory levels to support product availability, especially in response to global supply chain disruptions, further complicates traditional inventory metrics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the calculated inventory turnover ratio of 5.4 times indicates a healthy turnover rate relative to industry standards, it is essential to consider the broader context of J&J's diversified operations and strategic inventory management practices when interpreting this metric.",

The successful launch and market penetration of recently approved products, combined with anticipated label expansions, are expected to contribute significantly to revenue growth and, consequently, to adjusted EPS.\n\nFurthermore, we are implementing rigorous cost management initiatives across all business segments, which are expected to enhance operational efficiency and leverage our margins. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, including strategic investments in R&D and selective acquisitions that align with our long-term growth strategy, reinforces our outlook.\n\nWe also foresee a favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, which, based on current exchange rates, could enhance our earnings when translated back to USD. \n\nGiven these dynamics, we are confident in our ability to achieve accelerated growth in adjusted EPS for FY2023, with our guidance reflecting a year-over-year increase that aligns with our long-term growth objectives and shareholder value creation strategy.

Specifically, U.S. sales demonstrated a robust growth rate of 5.2%, driven primarily by increased demand in our pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which benefited from innovative product launches and strategic pricing initiatives. \n\nIn contrast, international sales growth outpaced U.S. performance, achieving a remarkable 9.1% increase year-over-year. This growth can be attributed to our successful expansion in emerging markets, coupled with favorable foreign currency exchange rates that positively impacted our revenue figures. Notably, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions contributed significantly to this growth, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our global footprint and diversifying our revenue streams. \n\nOverall, while U.S. sales growth remains a critical component of our overall financial performance, the stronger international sales growth underscores our strategic focus on global market penetration and the resilience of our diversified portfolio. This divergence in sales performance is indicative of both the challenges and opportunities present in varying market conditions across our global operations.",

This decision aligns with our long-term strategy to streamline operations and focus on our core pharmaceutical and medical device segments, which continue to demonstrate robust growth and innovation potential.\n\nEffective from the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the results of the Consumer Health segment will be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. This classification will allow us to present the financial performance of our continuing operations more clearly, enhancing transparency for our investors. \n\nThe divestiture is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Furthermore, we anticipate that the net cash proceeds from this divestiture will be utilized to enhance shareholder value through targeted investments in our high-growth business segments and to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\n\nFor additional details regarding the financial implications of this decision, including estimated losses and cash flows associated with the Consumer Health segment, please refer to our upcoming quarterly earnings report and the accompanying notes to our financial statements. We believe this strategic pivot will enhance our overall financial performance and strengthen our position in the marketplace.",

    "expanded_query": "As of August 30, 2023, Johnson & Johnson (JnJ) recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $7.4 billion associated with the separation of its Consumer Health business segment. This figure represents the estimated fair value of the net assets transferred, adjusted for transaction-related costs and tax implications. The separation, executed as part of our strategic realignment to enhance operational focus, resulted in a non-recurring gain recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe gain is primarily attributable to the successful divestiture of the Consumer Health segment, which we believe will enable us to allocate capital more effectively and drive long-term shareholder value. Moreover, we anticipate that this strategic move will facilitate enhanced growth trajectories for both the remaining pharmaceutical and medical device segments, as well as the newly independent Consumer Health entity.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency with our investors and will provide further details regarding the implications of this transaction in our upcoming Form 10-Q filing. Additionally, we will address this matter in greater detail during our next earnings call, where we will discuss our financial outlook and strategic initiatives post-separation.",

This transaction, executed through an initial public offering (IPO) followed by a spin-off, marks a strategic shift in our portfolio, enabling us to focus on our core pharmaceutical and medical device operations while providing Kenvue with the autonomy to pursue its growth initiatives.\n\nThe cash proceeds received reflect the fair value of the equity interest distributed to shareholders and are intended to enhance our liquidity position, support ongoing investment in innovation, and return capital to shareholders. As disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, these proceeds will be utilized for various strategic purposes, including potential share repurchases and the funding of R&D initiatives aimed at bolstering our pipeline.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining robust financial health and flexibility following this transaction. The separation is expected to unlock value for both J&J and Kenvue, allowing each entity to pursue distinct operational strategies tailored to their respective markets. The successful execution of this separation aligns with our long-term strategic objectives and is anticipated to enhance shareholder value over time.\n\nFor additional details regarding the financial implications of this transaction, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2023, where we will provide further disclosures on the impact of the separation on our financial statements and operating performance.",

This reflects a notable increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales compared to Q2 of FY2022, where the company achieved net earnings of $3.8 billion on total sales of $18.5 billion, resulting in a net margin of approximately 20.5%. \n\nThe year-over-year improvement in net earnings margin can be attributed to several factors, including operational efficiencies, a favorable product mix, and effective cost management strategies. Additionally, our ongoing investments in innovation and market expansion have contributed to a higher revenue base, thereby enhancing our profitability metrics. \n\nOverall, the increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales from 20.5% to 22% signifies a robust performance in our core segments and aligns with our strategic objectives of delivering sustainable, profitable growth while maximizing shareholder value.",

The segment that generated the lowest net revenue during this period was the **Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB)** division, which reported net revenue of $3.5 billion. This figure reflects a decrease compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a decline in fixed income markets and reduced client activity amid evolving market conditions. In contrast, the **Consumer & Community Banking** segment continued to demonstrate resilience, achieving net revenue of $14.3 billion, driven by strong deposit growth and increased mortgage lending. We will continue to monitor market dynamics and adjust our strategic initiatives to optimize performance across all segments.",

    "query": "If JPM went bankrupted by the end by 2021 Q1 and liquidated all of its assets to pay its shareholders, how much could each shareholder get?",
    "expanded_query": "In the event that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) were to declare bankruptcy by the end of the first quarter of 2021 and subsequently liquidate all of its assets, the distribution to shareholders would be contingent upon several critical factors, including the total value of liquidated assets, the outstanding liabilities, and the priority of claims as stipulated under bankruptcy law.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, JPM reported total assets amounting to approximately $3.2 trillion, with total liabilities of approximately $3.0 trillion, resulting in a net asset value of roughly $200 billion. However, it is essential to note that the actual realizable value upon liquidation may differ due to market conditions, asset depreciation, and transaction costs associated with the liquidation process.\n\nIn a bankruptcy scenario, the payment hierarchy would prioritize secured creditors, followed by unsecured creditors, and lastly, equity shareholders. Given that the majority of JPM\u2019s liabilities are likely to be secured, the residual value available for common shareholders may be significantly diminished. \n\nAssuming the liquidation process yields a net realizable amount of $150 billion after satisfying all secured and unsecured claims, and considering JPM has approximately 3 billion shares outstanding, the estimated distribution per share to common shareholders could be approximated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Distribution per Share} = \\frac{\\text{Net Realizable Assets}}{\\text{Total Shares Outstanding}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated Distribution per Share} = \\frac{150,000,000,000}{3,000,000,000} \\approx 50.00 \\]\n\nThus, in this hypothetical scenario, each common shareholder could expect to receive approximately $50.00 per share upon liquidation, contingent upon the aforementioned variables. It is critical to highlight that these figures are purely illustrative and subject to substantial variability based on actual market conditions, the state of the assets at the time of liquidation, and the legal proceedings associated with the bankruptcy process. Furthermore, this analysis does not account for any potential dilution from preferred equity or other equity instruments that may exist within the capital structure of the firm. \n\nInvestors should also be aware that the risks associated with such a scenario underscore the importance of thorough due diligence and risk assessment in the management of investment portfolios.",

    "expanded_query": "As per our analysis of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), it is important to note that gross margins, while a common metric in traditional manufacturing and retail sectors, are not the most relevant indicator for financial institutions such as JPM. The nature of our business model primarily revolves around financial intermediation, including services such as investment banking, asset management, and consumer and commercial banking.\n\nInstead of gross margin, we focus on metrics more indicative of our performance, such as net interest margin (NIM) and return on equity (ROE). The net interest margin reflects the difference between the interest income generated and the interest paid out to lenders, which is crucial for assessing the profitability of our lending activities. Furthermore, ROE provides insight into how effectively we are utilizing our equity capital to generate profits.\n\nHistorically, JPM's net interest margin has exhibited variability in response to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in the economic environment, which can deviate significantly from the 2% threshold typically observed in gross margins of non-financial companies. Consequently, while gross margins may not provide meaningful insights into our financial health, our other key performance indicators allow us to effectively gauge our operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nIn summary, for JPMorgan Chase & Co., gross margins are not a relevant metric. Instead, stakeholders should focus on our net interest margin and return on equity to better understand our financial performance and the underlying dynamics of our business model.",

Notably, the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) segment achieved the highest net income, contributing $3.1 billion to the firm's consolidated net income. This performance was driven by strong trading revenues, particularly in fixed income and equities, alongside higher investment banking fees resulting from increased M&A activity and capital raising transactions. The CIB's return on equity (ROE) for the quarter was approximately 20%, reflecting effective capital management and strategic positioning in the market. In contrast, the Consumer & Community Banking segment reported a net income of $1.5 billion, which, while solid, was lower than that of the CIB. Overall, the firm's diversified revenue streams and prudent risk management practices have positioned JPMorgan Chase to capitalize on market opportunities.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating the Value at Risk (VaR) for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the second fiscal quarter of 2023, we observed a notable decrease in our risk exposure relative to the same period in the prior year. Specifically, the average VaR for our trading portfolio decreased by approximately 15%, reflecting a more favorable market environment and improved risk management practices implemented during the year.\n\nThis reduction in VaR can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, we experienced enhanced diversification within our asset classes, as well as a reduction in the volatility of our trading positions. Additionally, proactive measures taken to recalibrate our risk appetite in response to macroeconomic conditions contributed significantly to this decline. These measures included a strategic reduction in our exposure to certain high-risk sectors and an increase in liquid asset holdings, which collectively enhanced our overall risk profile.\n\nFurthermore, our rigorous stress testing and scenario analysis have indicated that our current risk measures remain robust, and we continue to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds regulatory requirements. As we move forward, we remain committed to optimizing our risk management framework to adapt to evolving market conditions while safeguarding shareholder value.\n\nOverall, the decrease in VaR underscores our ongoing efforts to enhance our risk management capabilities and aligns with our strategic objective of maintaining a resilient balance sheet in the face of potential market fluctuations.",

    "expanded_query": "In accordance with our financial reporting and analysis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we have calculated Kraft Heinz's inventory turnover ratio as a key performance indicator of our operational efficiency regarding inventory management.\n\nFor FY2019, our Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) amounted to $22.4 billion. To derive the average inventory for the calculation, we reference our balance sheet data, which indicates that our ending inventory for FY2019 was $4.5 billion, while the ending inventory for FY2018 stood at $4.8 billion. Therefore, the average inventory for the period is calculated as:\n\nAverage Inventory = (Ending Inventory FY2018 + Ending Inventory FY2019) / 2  \nAverage Inventory = ($4.8 billion + $4.5 billion) / 2  \nAverage Inventory = $4.65 billion\n\nSubsequently, the inventory turnover ratio is computed as follows:\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = $22.4 billion / $4.65 billion  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 4.82\n\nRounded to two decimal places, Kraft Heinz's inventory turnover ratio for FY2019 is 4.82. This metric reflects our commitment to optimizing inventory levels and enhancing operational efficiency, ultimately contributing to our overall financial performance. We will continue to monitor this ratio closely as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our supply chain and inventory management strategies.",

Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "expanded_query": "In assessing Lockheed Martin's asset turnover ratio for the fiscal year 2020, we utilized the standard formula, which is defined as total revenue divided by average total assets. According to the financial statements included in our 10-K filing for FY2020, Lockheed Martin reported total revenues of $65.4 billion.\n\nTo determine average total assets, we calculated the mean of total assets at the end of FY2019 and FY2020. As per our balance sheet, total assets for FY2019 were reported at $45.1 billion, while total assets for FY2020 were $49.0 billion. Therefore, the average total assets for the period can be computed as follows:\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Total Assets FY2019 + Total Assets FY2020) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = ($45.1 billion + $49.0 billion) / 2  \nAverage Total Assets = $47.05 billion\n\nSubstituting these values into the asset turnover ratio formula yields:\n\nAsset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Total Assets  \nAsset Turnover Ratio = $65.4 billion / $47.05 billion  \nAsset Turnover Ratio \u2248 1.39\n\nThus, Lockheed Martin's asset turnover ratio for FY2020 is approximately **1.39**, indicating the efficiency with which the company utilized its assets to generate revenue during the fiscal year. This performance metric reflects our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and effective asset management.",

Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the balance sheet.",
    "expanded_query": "As an investment analyst evaluating Lockheed Martin's financial position for the fiscal year 2021, we can derive the net working capital by referencing the company\u2019s balance sheet. According to the reported figures, Lockheed Martin's total current assets for FY2021 amounted to $25,000 million. Concurrently, the total current liabilities were reported at $20,000 million.\n\nTo calculate the net working capital, we apply the formula:\n\n**Net Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities**\n\nSubstituting in the values from the balance sheet:\n\n**Net Working Capital = $25,000 million - $20,000 million = $5,000 million**\n\nThus, Lockheed Martin's net working capital for FY2021 stands at **$5,000 million**. This reflects the company's liquidity position and operational efficiency in managing short-term financial obligations. A positive net working capital figure indicates that Lockheed Martin is in a solid position to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets, which is a favorable indicator for stakeholders and potential investors.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating Lockheed Martin's revenue performance over the two-year period from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022, we calculated the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to assess the growth trajectory of the company's top-line revenue.\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, Lockheed Martin reported total revenues of $65.4 billion. By fiscal year 2022, total revenues increased to $67.0 billion. To compute the CAGR over this two-year span, we utilized the formula:\n\nCAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1, where n is the number of years.\n\nSubstituting in the values, we have:\n\nCAGR = ($67.0 billion / $65.4 billion)^(1/2) - 1.\n\nCalculating the CAGR yields:\n\nCAGR = (1.0245)^(0.5) - 1 = 0.0122 or 1.2%.\n\nThus, Lockheed Martin's total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022 is approximately **1.2%**. This growth reflects the company's resilient demand for its products and services in the defense sector, despite the challenges posed by a dynamic macroeconomic environment. This performance underscores our commitment to maintaining a competitive edge through innovation and strategic investments in R&D.",

    "expanded_query": "In analyzing MGM Resorts' capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue over the fiscal years 2018 to 2020, we have derived the following results based on the data presented in the company's statements of cash flows and income statements.\n\nFor FY2018, MGM Resorts reported total revenue of $11.8 billion and capital expenditures of $1.1 billion, resulting in a capex to revenue ratio of approximately 9.3%. In FY2019, with total revenue of $12.9 billion and capex of $1.2 billion, the capex as a percentage of revenue was approximately 9.3% again. For FY2020, impacted by the global pandemic, total revenue fell to $5.2 billion with capital expenditures of $0.5 billion, leading to a capex to revenue ratio of approximately 9.6%.\n\nCalculating the three-year average, we find:\n\n- FY2018: 9.3%\n- FY2019: 9.3%\n- FY2020: 9.6%\n\nThe average capex as a percentage of revenue over the three-year period (FY2018 - FY2020) is therefore calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Capex % of Revenue} = \\frac{(9.3 + 9.3 + 9.6)}{3} = \\frac{28.2}{3} = 9.4\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the three-year average of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020 is approximately **9.4%**. This metric reflects the company's ongoing commitment to reinvestment in its infrastructure and growth initiatives, even amidst challenging market conditions in FY2020.",

This significant performance was driven by a robust recovery in tourism and gaming activities following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The Las Vegas Strip's EBITDAR margin improved to 41%, reflecting a strong operational leverage as revenues grew across both gaming and non-gaming segments. Furthermore, the region benefitted from increased average daily rates in hotel accommodations and a resurgence in convention and group business, which positively impacted overall profitability. As a result, the Las Vegas Strip remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, underscoring our strategic focus on optimizing asset performance and enhancing shareholder value.",

To calculate the interest coverage ratio, we divide Adjusted EBIT by the annual interest expense.\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense\nInterest Coverage Ratio = $1.2 billion / $350 million\nInterest Coverage Ratio = 3.43\n\nThis indicates that MGM Resorts International generated approximately 3.43 times the earnings before interest and taxes relative to our interest obligations, reflecting a strong capacity to meet our interest payments.

Notably, the Las Vegas Strip segment reported the weakest topline performance, with revenues declining by approximately 15% year-over-year. This decline was primarily attributable to a combination of reduced domestic travel and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower visitation rates and decreased average daily room rates. \n\nAdditionally, we observed a significant reduction in group bookings and convention business, which are critical drivers of revenue for our Las Vegas properties. While our regional segments, particularly those in the Midwest and Atlantic City, showed resilience and recorded year-over-year growth, the Las Vegas Strip's performance was adversely affected by these external factors. \n\nMoving forward, we are implementing strategic initiatives aimed at revitalizing demand in this key market, including targeted marketing campaigns and enhancements to our entertainment offerings, with the goal of returning to pre-pandemic revenue levels in the upcoming fiscal year.",

The average maturity of these instruments was approximately 30 days, ensuring that we maintain a robust cash position to meet any immediate operational needs or capital requirements.\n\nAdditionally, we closely monitored market conditions to capitalize on favorable interest rates, which allowed us to enhance our investment returns while adhering to our prudent risk management framework.

Specifically, total long-term debt rose from $45 billion as of June 30, 2022, to $55 billion as of June 30, 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of approximately 22.2%. \n\nThis increase in debt was primarily attributable to the company\u2019s strategic initiatives aimed at funding ongoing investments in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other growth opportunities, as well as refinancing existing obligations to take advantage of favorable interest rate conditions. \n\nThe company continues to maintain a robust capital structure, with a debt-to-equity ratio that remains well within industry standards. Moreover, Microsoft\u2019s strong cash flow generation capabilities, evidenced by a net cash flow from operating activities of $75 billion for FY2023, provide a solid foundation for servicing its debt obligations. \n\nManagement believes that this prudent leverage strategy is aligned with our long-term growth objectives and enhances shareholder value, while still upholding our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. \n\nWe will continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to optimize our capital structure further and will provide updates in our upcoming quarterly filings.",

Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the statement of income, what is Nike's three year average of cost of goods sold as a % of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.",
    "expanded_query": "Based on our analysis of the financial statements contained within Nike, Inc.'s Form 10-K filings for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we have calculated the average cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue over the specified three-year period.\n\nFor FY2016, Nike reported total revenues of $32.4 billion and cost of goods sold amounting to $19.3 billion, resulting in a COGS as a percentage of revenue of approximately 59.7%. In FY2017, total revenues increased to $34.4 billion, with COGS of $20.4 billion, yielding a COGS percentage of approximately 59.3%. In FY2018, revenues were reported at $36.4 billion, with COGS at $21.2 billion, which calculates to a COGS percentage of approximately 58.3%.\n\nTo derive the three-year average COGS as a percentage of revenue, we aggregate the COGS percentages for the three fiscal years:\n\n- FY2016: 59.7%\n- FY2017: 59.3%\n- FY2018: 58.3%\n\nThe average COGS as a percentage of revenue for the three-year period from FY2016 to FY2018 is calculated as follows:\n\nAverage COGS % = (59.7% + 59.3% + 58.3%) / 3 = 59.1%\n\nTherefore, the three-year average of cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018 is approximately **59.1%**. This metric provides insight into the company's cost structure and efficiency in managing production costs relative to revenue generation over the evaluated period.",

    "expanded_query": "In evaluating Nike's operational efficiency regarding inventory management for the fiscal year 2021, we calculated the inventory turnover ratio using the company's reported Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and average inventory figures. For FY2021, Nike reported a COGS of $20 billion. The average inventory for the fiscal year, calculated as the mean of the ending inventory for FY2020 and FY2021, was determined to be $5 billion.\n\nUsing the inventory turnover ratio formula:\n\n**Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory**\n\nWe substitute the values:\n\n**Inventory Turnover Ratio = $20 billion / $5 billion = 4.00.**\n\nTherefore, Nike's inventory turnover ratio for FY2021 is 4.00, indicating that the company was able to turn over its inventory four times during the fiscal year. This metric reflects Nike's efficient inventory management practices and strong sales performance, aligning with our strategic focus on maintaining optimal inventory levels to support demand while minimizing excess stock.",

    "query": "Among operations, investing, and financing activities, which brought in the most (or lost the least) cash flow for Nike in FY2023?",
    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2023, Nike, Inc. experienced a robust performance across its cash flow activities, with operating activities serving as the primary driver of cash generation. The net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $5.2 billion, reflecting a solid increase from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to enhanced sales performance and effective working capital management. \n\nInvesting activities, on the other hand, utilized cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, predominantly attributable to capital expenditures related to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and investments in digital infrastructure to support our direct-to-consumer strategy. This investment aligns with our long-term growth initiatives and commitment to innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $2.3 billion, driven by the repayment of debt obligations and the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \n\nOverall, the cash flows from operating activities significantly outweighed the cash outflows from investing and financing activities, underscoring Nike's strong operational efficiency and continued commitment to generating shareholder value. This strategic focus positions us favorably to navigate potential market fluctuations while pursuing sustainable growth.",

(hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\") reported a current assets total of $18.3 billion and current liabilities of $16.5 billion. Consequently, the calculated working capital amounted to $1.8 billion, indicating that the Company does indeed possess positive working capital.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that while positive working capital is generally viewed as a favorable indicator of a company's short-term financial health, its relevance for PayPal may be limited due to the nature of its business model. As a leading digital payments platform, PayPal operates with a unique capital structure that emphasizes cash flow management and liquidity over traditional inventory and receivables. \n\nMoreover, the Company typically maintains a significant portion of its current assets in cash and cash equivalents, along with short-term investments that serve as a buffer for operational flexibility. This liquidity strategy allows PayPal to effectively manage its payment processing obligations and invest in growth initiatives, thereby mitigating reliance on working capital as a primary performance metric.\n\nIn conclusion, while PayPal does exhibit positive working capital, stakeholders should consider this metric in conjunction with other performance indicators, such as cash flow from operations and total liquidity position, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Company\u2019s financial health and operational efficiency.",

(the \"Company\") operates in a diverse array of geographic markets, segmented primarily into six key operating divisions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. \n\nIn North America, PepsiCo continues to leverage its strong market presence through its flagship brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker, which contributed significantly to the segment's revenue growth. Latin America remains a strategic focus, where the Company has seen substantial gains, particularly in the snack and beverage categories, driven by increasing consumer demand and strategic marketing initiatives.\n\nIn Europe, the Company has established a robust distribution network that enables it to capitalize on both emerging and developed markets, with particular strength in markets such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The Africa, Middle East, and South Asia (AMESA) segment has shown promising growth potential, driven by a young demographic and rising disposable incomes, with the Company actively investing in local operations to enhance market penetration.\n\nLastly, the Asia Pacific region, encompassing key markets such as China and India, represents a significant growth opportunity for PepsiCo. The Company is focused on expanding its product portfolio to cater to diverse consumer preferences while optimizing supply chain efficiencies to improve overall market competitiveness.\n\nOverall, PepsiCo's geographic diversity not only enhances its resilience against market volatility but also positions the Company for sustained long-term growth across its global operations. This strategic geographic segmentation is integral to our overall business strategy, aligning with our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and consumer engagement.",

    "expanded_query": "As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and compliance with applicable regulations, we wish to address the inquiries regarding material legal proceedings that may impact our financial position and operational performance in fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\nDuring FY2022, PepsiCo, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) is currently involved in several legal matters that are deemed material to our operations. Notably, we are defending against a class-action lawsuit alleging violations of consumer protection laws related to our marketing practices. This case is currently in the discovery phase, and while we believe we have meritorious defenses, we recognize that litigation outcomes are inherently uncertain. As such, we have established a reserve in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450, which reflects our best estimate of the potential liability associated with this matter.\n\nIn FY2021, we disclosed a significant legal proceeding involving a patent infringement claim against a competitor regarding our proprietary beverage formulations. The litigation concluded favorably for PepsiCo, resulting in a dismissal of the claims against us. The resolution of this matter did not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, as reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to actively monitor other legal proceedings that may arise, including environmental regulations and labor disputes, which could have a potential impact on our business operations. We remain committed to managing these risks through our robust compliance framework and legal strategies.\n\nIn summary, while we are aware of ongoing legal challenges, we believe that our financial position remains strong and adequately capitalized to absorb potential liabilities arising from these matters, as detailed in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We will continue to provide updates on any developments in these cases as required by SEC guidelines.",

    "expanded_query": "As an investment analyst reviewing PepsiCo's financials for FY2022, we start by calculating the unadjusted EBITDA and then subtracting capital expenditures (capex) to derive the unadjusted EBITDA less capex.\n\nFrom the consolidated income statement for FY2022, we find the following relevant figures:\n\n- **Operating Income**: $10,500 million\n- **Depreciation and Amortization**: $3,200 million (as reported in the statement of cash flows)\n\nUsing the definition of unadjusted EBITDA, we calculate:\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA** = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization  \n**Unadjusted EBITDA** = $10,500 million + $3,200 million  \n**Unadjusted EBITDA** = $13,700 million\n\nNext, we must account for capital expenditures, which can be sourced from the statement of cash flows. For FY2022, PepsiCo reported:\n\n- **Capital Expenditures (Capex)**: $4,200 million\n\nNow, we can compute unadjusted EBITDA less capex:\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex** = Unadjusted EBITDA - Capex  \n**Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex** = $13,700 million - $4,200 million  \n**Unadjusted EBITDA less Capex** = $9,500 million\n\nIn summary, for FY2022, PepsiCo's unadjusted EBITDA less capex is **$9,500 million**. This figure provides insight into the company's operational performance and cash-generating ability after accounting for necessary capital investments.",

    "expanded_query": "Based on the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2022, PepsiCo reported an unadjusted operating income of $12.5 billion. In conjunction with this, the depreciation and amortization (D&A) amount reported in the statement of cash flows for the same fiscal year was $3.2 billion. \n\nTo calculate the unadjusted EBITDA, we sum the unadjusted operating income and the D&A:\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA Calculation:**\n\nUnadjusted Operating Income: $12.5 billion  \nAdd: Depreciation and Amortization: $3.2 billion  \n**Unadjusted EBITDA** = $12.5 billion + $3.2 billion = $15.7 billion\n\nNext, to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA percentage margin, we need to divide the unadjusted EBITDA by total revenues. For FY2022, PepsiCo reported total revenues of $82.0 billion.\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin Calculation:**\n\nUnadjusted EBITDA: $15.7 billion  \nTotal Revenues: $82.0 billion  \n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin** = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenues) * 100  \n= ($15.7 billion / $82.0 billion) * 100  \n= 19.15%\n\nIn summary, PepsiCo's unadjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year 2022 is approximately **19.15%**, reflecting the company\u2019s operational efficiency and ability to generate earnings before the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This metric is indicative of the company\u2019s robust performance in a competitive market landscape.",

    "expanded_query": "At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of PepsiCo, Inc. (the \"Company\") held on May 3, 2023, shareholders voted on a proposal requesting the Company to prepare a congruency report concerning its net-zero emissions policies. The proposal, which sought to enhance transparency around PepsiCo's sustainability initiatives and alignment with the science-based targets for carbon emissions reduction, received significant attention from both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe results of the shareholder vote were as follows: approximately 62% of the shares voted were in favor of the proposal, reflecting increasing shareholder interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. The Board of Directors, while acknowledging the importance of sustainability, recommended a vote against the proposal, citing the Company's existing commitments and comprehensive reporting practices related to climate change and sustainability initiatives.\n\nDespite the Board's recommendation, the strong support from shareholders illustrates a growing demand for enhanced disclosures in the area of climate risk management and sustainability governance. The Company is committed to engaging with its shareholders and will consider the feedback received during the AGM as it continues to evolve its sustainability strategy.\n\nThe outcome of this vote may influence the Company\u2019s future disclosure practices and the development of its strategic initiatives aimed at achieving its long-term sustainability goals. PepsiCo remains committed to its environmental objectives and will continue to provide updates on its progress in future filings, including the upcoming Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2023.",

    "expanded_query": "In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, PepsiCo, Inc. (the \"Company\") raised its full-year guidance based on several key performance indicators that exceeded management's initial expectations. This revision was primarily driven by robust organic revenue growth, which was fueled by strong demand across our core beverage and snack segments, particularly in international markets.\n\nThe Company reported a year-over-year increase in net revenues, reflecting a 7% growth in volume and a favorable price/mix impact as a result of strategic pricing initiatives implemented to offset inflationary pressures on input costs. Additionally, improvements in supply chain efficiencies and effective inventory management contributed to enhanced gross margins, which rose by 150 basis points compared to the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, the positive momentum in brand performance, supported by innovative marketing campaigns and product launches, has strengthened our competitive positioning. As a result, the Company is now projecting a full-year revenue growth of 8% to 10%, an upward revision from the previous guidance of 5% to 7%. \n\nWe also anticipate continued improvements in operating income and adjusted earnings per share (EPS), with a revised forecast of $6.50 to $6.70, reflecting a strong trajectory in profitability and cash flow generation. \n\nIn conclusion, the upward adjustment in our full-year guidance demonstrates our confidence in PepsiCo\u2019s strategic initiatives and operational resilience, positioning us well to deliver shareholder value while navigating a dynamic economic landscape.",

As reported in our consolidated balance sheets, PPNE rose from $31.2 billion in FY20 to $38.7 billion in FY21, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 24%.\n\nThis increase can be attributed primarily to strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities to support the production of our COVID-19 vaccine and other essential therapeutics. The capital expenditures for FY21 amounted to $7.5 billion, focusing on facility enhancements and equipment upgrades, which have been critical in scaling our operations and meeting heightened global demand.\n\nMoreover, we conducted a thorough impairment analysis, and no impairments were recognized during this period, further affirming the value and utility of our invested assets. The growth in PPNE is a testament to our commitment to long-term value creation and operational excellence, positioning Pfizer for sustained growth and innovation in the biopharmaceutical sector.\n\nIn summary, Pfizer did indeed grow its PPNE between FY20 and FY21, underscoring our robust investment strategy and operational capacity expansion.",

    "expanded_query": "In 2019, Pfizer Inc. experienced a notable increase in net income primarily due to a series of non-recurring events that are not typical of our standard business operations. Specifically, the company recognized a significant gain from the divestiture of its consumer healthcare segment, which was executed to streamline our operational focus and enhance shareholder value. This transaction, completed in the third quarter of 2019, resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $3.5 billion, contributing positively to our overall financial performance for the year.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer benefitted from a favorable resolution of certain legal contingencies, which resulted in a reduction of previously accrued liabilities. The reversal of these liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and was reflected in our other income line item within the consolidated statement of income. \n\nFurthermore, our ongoing investment in research and development yielded promising results, leading to a one-time milestone payment of $500 million associated with the advancement of our collaboration with BioNTech in the oncology space. This milestone payment was recognized in the fourth quarter, further bolstering our net income for the fiscal year.\n\nIt is important to note that while these events contributed significantly to our 2019 financial results, they are not indicative of our core operational performance. We remain committed to delivering sustainable growth through our diversified portfolio and continued focus on innovation and market expansion. \n\nOverall, the net income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by 25% year-over-year, driven largely by these atypical factors, alongside our robust underlying business performance in key therapeutic areas.",

The integration of Wyeth\u2019s robust pipeline has significantly bolstered our research and development capabilities and has contributed positively to our revenue streams, particularly in vaccines and oncology.\n\n2. **Array BioPharma**: In 2019, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Array BioPharma for $11.4 billion. This acquisition has strengthened our oncology portfolio, particularly with the addition of the approved products Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), which are pivotal in treating specific forms of melanoma. The acquisition aligns with our strategic focus on precision medicine and enhances our ability to deliver innovative therapies to patients.\n\n3. **King Pharmaceuticals**: Acquired in 2010 for approximately $3.6 billion, this strategic purchase allowed Pfizer to enhance its pain management portfolio and expand its therapeutic offerings in the central nervous system category. The integration of King\u2019s product line has contributed to our revenue growth and strengthened our position in a competitive market.\n\nThese acquisitions are testament to Pfizer's commitment to strategic growth and innovation, positioning us to deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders while advancing our mission to improve global health outcomes.",

Specifically, the Asia-Pacific segment experienced a revenue decrease of 25% compared to Q2 2022. This decline can be attributed to several factors, including intensified competition within the pharmaceutical market, supply chain disruptions, and a reduction in demand for certain COVID-19 related products as the global health landscape continues to evolve.\n\nIn contrast, our North American and European segments demonstrated more resilient performance, with revenue decreases of only 10% and 15%, respectively. The divergence in regional performance underscores the varying market dynamics and consumer demand trends we are currently navigating.\n\nWe remain committed to strategically addressing these challenges through targeted investments in R&D and robust marketing initiatives, aiming to bolster our product pipeline and enhance our market position in the Asia-Pacific region moving forward.",

This strategic review is intended to streamline operations and focus resources on our high-growth therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology and rare diseases.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20, \"Discontinued Operations,\" any potential spin-off would be assessed based on the materiality of the segment and its financial impact on our consolidated results. Our leadership remains committed to maintaining transparency with our investors and will provide updates in future filings and earnings calls should the evaluation process yield actionable results.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to monitor market conditions and competitive dynamics, which may influence our strategic direction.

This improvement can be attributed to several key factors.\n\nFirstly, we implemented a series of operational efficiencies aimed at streamlining our administrative processes, which resulted in a reduction in overhead costs. Our focus on cost discipline allowed us to optimize our resource allocation without compromising on the quality of service provided to our customers.\n\nSecondly, we benefited from a strategic realignment of our marketing initiatives, which enabled us to enhance customer acquisition while decreasing overall marketing spend. The shift towards digital marketing channels proved to be significantly more cost-effective, thereby driving higher returns on our marketing investments.\n\nAdditionally, we recorded a favorable shift in our sales mix, with an increased contribution from higher-margin products. This shift not only bolstered our gross margin but also contributed to a more favorable SG&A ratio relative to our net sales.\n\nLastly, we continued to leverage technology and automation across various functions within the organization, which further reduced labor costs and enhanced productivity. The cumulative effect of these initiatives was a significant improvement in our operating leverage, allowing us to scale our sales more efficiently.\n\nWe remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our SG&A expenses as we pursue sustainable growth and profitability in the upcoming fiscal periods.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2023, Ulta Beauty experienced a significant increase in merchandise inventories, which rose by approximately 25% compared to the prior year. This increase can be attributed to several key factors aligned with our strategic growth initiatives and operational planning.\n\nFirstly, we enhanced our inventory levels in anticipation of robust consumer demand, particularly in our cosmetics and skincare categories, which have shown strong performance trends. This proactive inventory management approach was designed to ensure that we are well-positioned to capitalize on seasonal sales peaks and promotional events, thereby optimizing our in-stock positions across our retail locations and e-commerce platforms.\n\nSecondly, our expansion efforts, including the opening of new stores and the remodeling of existing locations, necessitated a corresponding increase in inventory to support a broader product assortment. By diversifying our merchandise mix, we aim to attract a wider customer base and increase our market share within the beauty industry.\n\nAdditionally, we experienced supply chain dynamics that resulted in longer lead times for certain key products. As a result, we strategically increased our inventory levels to mitigate potential disruptions and maintain uninterrupted product availability for our customers. This decision reflects our commitment to providing a seamless shopping experience and meeting the expectations of our loyal customer base.\n\nIn summary, the increase in merchandise inventories at the end of FY2023 was primarily driven by our strategic initiatives to meet anticipated demand, support store expansion, and navigate supply chain challenges, positioning Ulta Beauty for sustained growth in the upcoming fiscal periods.",

Specifically, wages and benefits expense represented approximately 22.5% of net sales, compared to 21.8% in the previous fiscal year. This uptick is primarily attributable to our commitment to enhancing employee compensation and benefits packages, as well as the expansion of our workforce to support growth initiatives and elevate customer service standards. \n\nDespite this increase in wage expenses, we are pleased to report that our overall sales growth outpaced the rise in labor costs, resulting in a robust operating margin. We continue to monitor labor market trends closely and are focused on optimizing our staffing levels to maintain operational efficiency while ensuring that we meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our ongoing investments in training and development are expected to yield long-term benefits, driving both employee engagement and ultimately, customer satisfaction. \n\nWe remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while navigating the challenges presented by the current economic environment.",

    "expanded_query": "In fiscal year 2021, Verizon Communications Inc. utilized a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Among these instruments, the foreign currency forward contracts represented the highest notional value, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion. These contracts were primarily employed to hedge against the impact of currency volatility on our international revenue streams and operational costs, thereby enhancing our financial stability.\n\nThe notional value of these derivatives reflects the total underlying amount upon which the cash flows are based, and while it does not represent the market value or potential future cash outflows, it is indicative of our strategic commitment to managing foreign exchange risk. In accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging,\" we continue to monitor the effectiveness of these hedging relationships and assess their impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives was recorded as a net asset of $150 million on our balance sheet, reflecting favorable exchange rate movements. We believe that our proactive approach to hedging has contributed positively to our overall financial performance and risk management framework, allowing us to focus on our core operations while minimizing potential adverse effects from market fluctuations.",

    "query": "Does Verizon have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.",
    "expanded_query": "As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Verizon Communications Inc. presents a liquidity profile characterized by a quick ratio of 0.85. This metric, which is calculated by dividing current assets minus inventories by current liabilities, indicates that Verizon has $0.85 in liquid assets for every dollar of current liabilities. \n\nWhile a quick ratio below 1.0 may suggest potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations without relying on inventory liquidation, it is essential to consider the broader context of Verizon's liquidity position. The nature of Verizon's operations, which include significant cash flow generation from its core telecommunications services, enhances its ability to service debt and cover short-term liabilities through operational cash flows rather than immediate asset liquidation.\n\nMoreover, Verizon maintains a robust cash and cash equivalents balance, complemented by substantial available credit facilities, which further supports its liquidity management strategy. Therefore, while the quick ratio may not reflect the entirety of Verizon's liquidity health, it is critical to assess this metric in conjunction with other indicators such as the current ratio, operating cash flow, and the company\u2019s access to credit markets.\n\nIn summary, while the quick ratio may indicate potential liquidity constraints, it is not the sole determinant of Verizon's financial health. The company's strong operational cash flows, coupled with a disciplined capital allocation strategy and prudent financial management, suggest a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for FY 2022.",

(Verizon) can indeed be characterized as a capital-intensive business. In our Form 10-K filing for FY 2022, we reported capital expenditures (CapEx) totaling approximately $18.5 billion, primarily focused on expanding our 5G network infrastructure and enhancing our fiber-optic capabilities. \n\nThis substantial investment underscores our commitment to long-term growth and competitive positioning within the telecommunications sector. The capital intensity is evident when analyzing our capital expenditure-to-revenue ratio, which stood at approximately 15%, reflecting our strategic prioritization of investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). \n\nAdditionally, our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year were reported at $12.3 billion, indicating a significant annual allocation of resources to maintain and enhance our existing asset base. These figures further illustrate the ongoing requirement for substantial capital investment to sustain operational efficiency and meet customer demand in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, our FY 2022 data confirm that Verizon operates in a capital-intensive environment, driven by the necessity to invest heavily in infrastructure to maintain service quality, expand market reach, and support innovation in telecommunications technology.",

    "expanded_query": "In reviewing Verizon Communications Inc.'s balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, we observed a notable increase in total debt. As of the end of fiscal year 2022, the company reported total long-term debt of $158 billion, up from $152 billion in the preceding fiscal year. This increase of approximately $6 billion, or 4%, can be attributed to our strategic initiatives aimed at expanding our 5G network capabilities and enhancing our overall capital structure.\n\nThe increase in debt was primarily financed through the issuance of senior notes during the fiscal year, which allowed us to fund capital expenditures while maintaining liquidity. Our debt-to-equity ratio has modestly increased, reflecting our ongoing investments in growth and innovation. We remain committed to managing our leverage prudently and are focused on maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that our enhanced debt profile, combined with our robust cash flow generation capabilities, positions us well to navigate potential market fluctuations while continuing to return value to our shareholders. The increased leverage is consistent with our long-term strategy and is expected to support our competitive advantage in the telecommunications sector.",

    "expanded_query": "For the three-year period spanning Fiscal Year 2018 to Fiscal Year 2020, Walmart Inc. reported the following unadjusted EBITDA figures calculated using the defined formula of unadjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization. \n\nIn FY2018, Walmart reported an operating income of $22.5 billion and depreciation and amortization of $10.2 billion, yielding an unadjusted EBITDA of $32.7 billion. This corresponds to a total revenue of $500.3 billion, resulting in an unadjusted EBITDA margin of 6.5%.\n\nIn FY2019, operating income was recorded at $23.3 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $10.5 billion. Consequently, unadjusted EBITDA for FY2019 was $33.8 billion, against total revenues of $514.4 billion, leading to an unadjusted EBITDA margin of 6.6%.\n\nFor FY2020, Walmart\u2019s operating income increased to $24.0 billion, with depreciation and amortization continuing at $10.7 billion, bringing unadjusted EBITDA for the year to $34.7 billion. Total revenues for FY2020 were $524.0 billion, which translates to an unadjusted EBITDA margin of 6.6%.\n\nTo determine the three-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin, we aggregate the individual fiscal year margins as follows:\n\n- FY2018 EBITDA Margin: 6.5%\n- FY2019 EBITDA Margin: 6.6%\n- FY2020 EBITDA Margin: 6.6%\n\nCalculating the average yields: \n\n(6.5% + 6.6% + 6.6%) / 3 = 6.5667%\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the three-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin for Walmart from FY2018 to FY2020 is **6.6%**. \n\nThis metric reflects Walmart's consistent operational efficiency and its ability to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization relative to its total revenue over the specified period.",
