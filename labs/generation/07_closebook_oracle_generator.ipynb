The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was\\nprimarily due to:\\n•\\nlower purchases of available-for-sale investments, with $65 million of purchases in 2019, as compared to $209 million in 2018;\\n•\\nhigher proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investments, with $153 million of proceeds in 2019, as compared to $116 million in 2018; and\\n•\\nlower capital expenditures, with $116 million of expenditures in 2019, as compared to $131 million in 2018.\\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\\nThe primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and\\ntransactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of\\ndividends.\\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $237 million, as compared to $2.0 billion for 2018.

The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was\\nprimarily due to:\\n•\\nlower purchases of available-for-sale investments, with $65 million of purchases in 2019, as compared to $209 million in 2018;\\n•\\nhigher proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investments, with $153 million of proceeds in 2019, as compared to $116 million in 2018; and\\n•\\nlower capital expenditures, with $116 million of expenditures in 2019, as compared to $131 million in 2018.\\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\\nThe primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and\\ntransactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of\\ndividends.\\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $237 million, as compared to $2.0 billion for 2018.
