financebench_id_00540,Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.,"To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we divide Cost of Sales by Average Inventory. For Regulated and Non-Regulated categories, the cost of sales for FY2022 are $(10,069) and $(6,907) respectively.

For the Regulated category, average inventory can be estimated as ((Inventory_Dec31_2022 + Inventory_Dec31_2021) / 2). Substituting values gives (($1,055 + $604) / 2 = $829 million). So the turnover ratio for Regulated is approximately 11.7 (= $10,069 / $829).

For the Non-Regulated category, average inventory can be estimated as ((Inventory_Dec31_2022 + Inventory_Dec31_2021) / 2). Substituting values gives (($1,799 + $1,418) / 2 = $1,558.5 million). So the turnover ratio for Non-Regulated is approximately 4.2 (= $6,907 / $1,558.5).

However, if the company's inventory levels are not consistent with conventional inventory management practices and the high inventory levels suggest a buildup of stock or an inefficient turnover process, it may not be meaningful to analyze the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation based solely on these financial statements. This is because a high inventory turnover ratio typically indicates efficient inventory management, while a low ratio suggests inefficiency or potential stockpiling issues. In this case, additional information about the company's inventory policies, production processes, and market conditions would be necessary to draw accurate conclusions about its inventory management practices.",mistral:7b,gemma3:12b,False

However, it's important to note that a gross margin profile may not always be a useful metric for a company like Amcor due to the nature of its operations. In this case, changes in raw material costs or currency exchange rates could significantly impact both net sales and cost of sales figures, making direct comparisons of gross margins across different periods less meaningful. Additionally, Amcor operates across multiple industries and geographies with varying profit margins, which could further complicate the interpretation of gross margin trends.

Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.,"To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we need to find out how many times Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory in a year. This is done by dividing Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by average inventory for the period.

Average inventory for the period is calculated as follows:
- FY2022 inventories: $12,483
- FY2021 inventories: $10,387
- Average Inventory: ($12,483 + $10,387) / 2 = $11,435.5

Now we can calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio by dividing COGS by average inventory:
- FY2022 Cost of Goods Sold: $31,089
- Inventory Turnover Ratio: $31,089 / $11,435.5 ≈ 2.73 times

Therefore, Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory approximately 2.73 times in FY2022.

Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for this company because it is a diversified and large multinational corporation with various product lines and businesses. A single ratio might not accurately represent the efficient management of inventories across all these different sectors.

Gross margin change for American Express in FY2022 is:
(52,862 - 50,680) - (42,380 - 43,799) = $2,182 million decrease in gross margin.

However, it's important to note that gross margin may not be a useful metric for American Express due to the nature of its business, which primarily deals with financial services and includes a significant amount of variable costs directly related to the revenues. The reason is that in financial service businesses like American Express, expenses such as card member rewards, business development, card member services, marketing, salaries and employee benefits are closely tied to the revenues generated from those activities. As a result, the gross margin may not provide a meaningful comparison of profitability between periods or with other companies operating in different industries.

However, it's important to note that the financial performance of a company like American Express can be affected by various factors beyond traditional operating margins, such as changes in interest rates, credit losses, and market conditions.

To calculate CCC, we first need to find DIO, DSO, and DPO:

1. DIO = (Average inventory from FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS) * 365
   Average inventory = (Inventories_2019 + Inventories_2018) / 2 = ($1,559.3 + $1,642.2) / 2 = $1,600.765 million
   COGS in FY2019 = Cost of sales_2019 = $11,108.4 million
   DIO = ($1,600.765 * 365) / $11,108.4 = 62.49 days

2. DSO = (Average accounts receivable from FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue) * 365
   Average accounts receivable = ($1,684.2 + $1,679.7) / 2 = $1,682.005 million
   Revenue in FY2019 = Net sales_2019 = $16,865.2 million
   DSO = ($1,682.005 * 365) / $16,865.2 = 71.43 days

3. DPO = (Average accounts payable from FY2018 and FY2019) / ((FY2019 COGS + Change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)) * 365
   Average accounts payable = ($2,746.2 + $2,854.1) / 2 = $2,799.66 million
   Change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 = Inventories_2019 - Inventories_2018 = ($1,559.3 - $1,642.2) = -$82.9 million
   DPO = ($2,799.66 * 365) / ($11,108.4 + (-$82.9)) = 50.64 days
