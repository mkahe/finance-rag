If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",Performance is not measured through operating margin,"Operating margin is not a particularly useful metric for American Express (AMEX) because the company's business model relies heavily on net interest income rather than traditional operating profit. AMEX earns significant revenue from non-interest sources such as card fees, service fees, and processed revenue, but its financial performance is also influenced by interest income from loans and investments. Therefore, a more relevant metric for assessing AMEX’s profitability would be net revenues after provisions for credit losses and interest expense rather than operating margin. 

However, if we were to consider the company's overall profitability profile:

- Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense increased from $36,087 million in 2020 to $52,862 million in 2022.
- Provisions for Credit Losses decreased significantly from a provision of $4,730 million in 2020 to $(1,419) million in 2021 and $2,182 million in 2022 (indicating less expected credit losses).

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",63.86,"To calculate the Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for Corning for FY2020, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Average Accounts Payable**:
   - Accounts Payable at December 31, 2019 = $1,587 million
   - Accounts Payable at December 31, 2020 = $1,174 million

   \[
   \text{Average Accounts Payable} = \frac{(1,587 + 1,174)}{2} = \frac{2,761}{2} = 1,380.5 \text{ million}
   \]

2. **Calculate Change in Inventory**:
   - Inventory at December 31, 2019 = $2,320 million
   - Inventory at December 31, 2020 = $2,438 million

   \[
   \text{Change in Inventory} = 2,438 - 2,320 = 118 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Calculate DPO**:
   - COGS for FY2020 = $7,772 million
   - Formula: 

   \[
   \text{DPO} = 365 \times \frac{\text{Average Accounts Payable}}{\text{COGS} + \text{Change in Inventory}}
   \]

   Substitute the values:

   \[
   \text{DPO} = 365 \times \frac{1,380.5}{7,772 + 118}
   \]

   \[
   \text{DPO} = 365 \times \frac{1,380.5}{7,890}
   \]

   \[
   \text{DPO} = 365 \times 0.17496 \approx 63.88
   \]

Thus, the FY2020 Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) for Corning is approximately **63.88** days.",phi4:14b,gemma3:12b,False
financebench_id_10136,We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the cash flow statement and the income statement. Here's the question: what is the FY2022 retention ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders) for General Mills? Round answer to two decimal places.,0.54,"To calculate the retention ratio, use the formula:

\[
\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \frac{\text{Dividends Paid}}{\text{Net Income Attributable to Shareholders}}
\]

From the context provided:
- Net earnings attributable to General Mills in FY2022: \$2,707.3 million
- Dividends paid (from cash flows): \$1,244.5 million

Now plug these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \frac{1,244.5}{2,707.3}
\]

Calculate the fraction:

\[
\frac{1,244.5}{2,707.3} \approx 0.4597
\]

Subtract from 1:

\[
1 - 0.4597 = 0.5403
\]

Round to two decimal places:

\[
\text{Retention Ratio} \approx 0.54
\] 

The FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills is approximately **0.54** or **54%**.",phi4:14b,gemma3:12b,True

Round your answer to two decimal places. Please base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,6.25,"To calculate Kraft Heinz's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{COGS for 2019}}{\text{Average Inventory between 2018 and 2019}}

From the provided information:
- COGS for 2019 = $16,830 million
- Inventory at December 28, 2019 = $2,721 million
- Inventory at December 29, 2018 = $2,667 million

First, calculate the average inventory:

\[
\text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Inventory at 2019} + \text{Inventory at 2018}}{2} = \frac{2,721 + 2,667}{2} = \frac{5,388}{2} = 2,694 \text{ million}

Now, calculate the inventory turnover ratio:

\[
