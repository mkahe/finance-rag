Calculation:

FY2015 Net Earnings: $1,246 million
FY2016 Net Earnings: $807 million
FY2017 Net Earnings: $1,228 million

Average Net Earnings: ($1,246 + $807 + $1,228) / 3 = $1,140.33 million

Total Revenue (average of FY2015-17):
($40,339 + $39,528 + $39,403) / 3 = $39,690.67 million

Net Profit Margin: ($1,140.33 million / $39,690.67 million) x 100% ≈ 2.87%
However, given the information is only available up to Net Earnings (before the income tax expense), we should directly use the 'Gross profit' and 'Operating income' for this calculation.

Total Revenue: ($40,339 + $39,528 + $39,403) / 3 = $39,690.67 million

Average Operating Income: ($1,450 + $1,375 + $1,854) / 3 = $1,526.33 million
Average Gross Profit: ($9,047 + $9,191 + $9,440) / 3 = $9,226 million

Net Profit Margin (Operating): ($1,526.33 million / $39,690.67 million) x 100% ≈ 3.85%
Net Profit Margin (Gross): ($9,226 million / $39,690.67 million) x 100% ≈ 23.29%

However, given the information and typical calculations for Net profit margin, we should directly use 'Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense' for this calculation.

Average Earnings: ($1,387 + $1,310 + $1,816) / 3 = $1,504.33 million
