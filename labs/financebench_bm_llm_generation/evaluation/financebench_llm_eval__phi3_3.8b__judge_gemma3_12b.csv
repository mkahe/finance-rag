-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The increase in SG&A expenses relative to sales affected the overall operating margin negatively during FY2thy2022 at 3M Company due to increased costs associated with significant litigation, impairment of PFAS manufacturing exiting assets and Russia-exit process. The divestiture related restructuring charges also contributed towards this change in operating margin as they led to a pre-tax charge during the second quarter amounting approximately $1.2 billion for Combat Arms Earplug litigation resolution efforts, certain impairment costs linked with exiting PFAS manufacturing and Russia along with divestiture related restructuring charges.

Operating margin can be a useful metric in assessing the efficiency of operations since it provides insight into how much profit each dollar of sales generates before interest and taxes are considered, which is vital for internal decision-making processes such as cost control strategies or pricing decisions. However, comparing operating margins across different companies isn't straightforward due to industry differences in capital intensity (fixed costs), product mix complexity, price sensitivity etc., thus making it less suitable for benchmarking purposes against other businesses not directly comparable within the same contexts and situations. It is also important to note that while a declining or low operating margin might indicate possible financial problems such as decreased pricing power or increased competition among others, this does not necessarily predict company's overall profitability in all scenarios due to potential effects of non-operating income items on the net profit (income before taxes).",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,True

Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.,7.9%,"To find the three-year average percentage of capital expenditures (capex) as a portion of revenue for MGM Resorts International, we look at the Statement of Cash Flows provided in the question to extract capex and operating income data. Capex is found under ""Capital Expenditures, net"" while operating income or loss can be calculated by subtracting depreciation/amortization from Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes on operations which are $583,894 thousand in FY2018.

For 2018: Capex = $(6,522 + 275,802 - 9,147)$ = $2,738,063$ thousands  
Revenue (income) before taxes = Earnings from operations (loss) in FY2018 plus provision for credit losses: $(-583,894 + 71,422)$ = $-512,472$ thousand (a loss indicates negative income).
Since the revenues are a significant number of positive thousands but expenses led to a net loss before taxes which also means we cannot simply use them as revenue for calculating percentages. However, it seems there may be an error in extracting information from ""Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes"" because typically income would not be negative when considering capex's impact on operations directly without further contextual data indicating revenues or other sources of positive funds that constitute revenue.

For 2019: Capex = $(-7,860 + (2,578 - 435,505))$ = $-4,763$ thousand  
Revenue calculation for FY2019 appears to be the same as above. Again a significant net loss before taxes and no positive revenue is evident from provided data which complicates this straightforward percentage-based comparison usually expected in such questions; hence there's likely an error or missing information that prevents completing the analysis properly under normal circumstances for FY2019 and 2020.

However, to follow instructions based on available data:  
Average Capex as % of Revenue (assuming all other figures are correct except revenue which is unavailable) = $\frac{Capex}{Loss before taxes} \times 100$ for both years and then the average over three-years, but this calculation wouldn't make sense due to a negative income.

Given these constraints and possible errors in available data or context (e.g., FY2018 - net loss would usually indicate non-recurring revenues are missing), an accurate answer cannot be provided from the information given, suggesting that there is likely more needed for proper analysis – specifically a positive revenue figure to work with alongside capex figures across three years and possibly pre-tax income before provision adjustments. Without this data or further context on how these numbers relate directly as revenues (or net losses), an accurate 3 year average calculation cannot be accurately completed, indicating that the provided task likely contains insufficient information to answer it correctly.",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False

Define unadjusted EBITDA as unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement. Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the cash flow statement.,6.2%,"To calculate Walmart's FY2018 - FY2020 three-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin, we first need to determine the operating income (EBIT) for each year from the consolidated Statements of Income and then adjust it by adding back depreciation and amortization. Finally, this figure is divided by net sales and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Here are the steps:

- Find EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for FY2018 and FY2019 from Walmart's Statement of Income by subtracting interest expenses but adding back depreciation ($10,678 + $320):
  - FY2018: EBITDA = Operating income (income before taxes) + Depreciation and amortization − Interest cost without considering the loss on exting095 from debt repayment. In this case, it's $10,523 million + $10,678 million - ($1,975 million + (net provision for income taxes of $-499 million)) = $19,126 million
  - FY2019: EBITDA = Operating income − Interest cost without considering the loss on extinguishment of debt. Here it's $7,179 + $320 - ($2,125) = $5,384 million
- Find Walmart’s net sales for each year from Consolidated Statements of Income: 
  - FY2018: Net Sales = $500.3 billion (since we're looking at the income before taxes which is essentially what 'net income attributable to WMT after noncontrolling interest and net loss on extinguishment’ represents, so this gives us an estimate)
  - FY2019: Net Sales = $514.4 billion (since we're looking at the same figure as in previous year for a comparison purpose). We will use this since EBITDA isn't directly available.)
- Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin using these figures, and then find an average of FY2018 - FY2019: 
   - FY2018 Unadjusted EBITDA % = (EBITDA / Net Sales) * 100% for Walmart. This gives us a margin around $37.4%. Assuming this pattern holds, we'd expect similar margins in subsequent years since no significant changes are reported from FY2018 - FY2019 to the next two fiscal year ends (which is consistent with standard P&L behavior and available data). 
- Finally calculate an average of these percentages for a three-year span. As we only have one complete set, it's reasonable to assume this figure would remain around $37.4%.",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False
