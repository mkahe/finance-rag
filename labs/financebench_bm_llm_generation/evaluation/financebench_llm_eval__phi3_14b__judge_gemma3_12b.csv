Operating income in millions:
FY2021: $2,112 million

FY2021: $14,082 million
FY2019: $11,503 million
(Note that for 2020 the net sales are not provided; therefore, we'll calculate an estimate using available information)

Unadjusted Operating Income Percentage Margin Calculation:
Estimated operating income for FY2020 = Net Sales (FY2019 and FY2021 average) - [(Selling, general & administrative expenses + Research, development & engineering expenses + Amortization of purchased intangibles)] from both years. 
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = ($14,082 million + $11,503 million) / 2 - (($1,794 million + $1,106 million + $125 million)*2/2)
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $12,792.5 million - ($3,025 million * 2 / 2)
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $12,792.5 million - $3,025 million
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $9,767.5 million

Operating income percentage margin:
FY2021 = ($2,112 / $14,082) * 100% = 15.0%
FY2019 = ($509 / $11,503) * 100% = 4.4%
Estimated FY2020 = ($9,767.5 / $12,792.5) * 100% = 76.3% (Note: This is a very high estimate due to the assumption we made; in reality, an actual operating income figure would be required for accuracy).

Average Operating Income Percentage Margin over FY2019 - FY2021:
(FY2021 + FY2019 + Estimated FY2020) / 3 = (15.0% + 4.4% + 76.3%) / 3 = 31.9%

The formula for EBITDA margin is: (EBITDA / Net Revenue) * 100%. Given the available information, we can estimate EBITDA using the Operating Profit from the Consolidated Statement of Income and adjust it by adding back Depreciation & Amortization expenses.

Assuming that operating income can be derived as Operating Income = Net Sales - Cost of sales - Operating expenses and using the cash flow statement's depreciation and amortization, we calculate unadjusted EBITDA for each year:

FY 2018: Unadjusted EBITDA = (495,761 - 373,396 - 106,510) + 10,529 = $12,384 million.  
FY 2019: Unadjusted EBITDA = (510,329 - 385,301 - 107,147) + 10,678 = $29,549 million.

EBITDA% Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenues) * 100

financebench_id_07966,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the average capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard over the three years provided, we first need to find the total capital expenditures (capex) from the Cash Flows from Investing activities section. Then, we will sum up the net revenues for each year and calculate the average capex percentage.

From the Cash Flows from Investing activities:

2017 Capex: $(-155)$ million (negative sign indicates an outflow)
2018 Capex: $(-131)$ million
2019 Capex: $(-116)$ million

Total Capex over three years = $-155 + -131 + -116 = -$402$ million (total outflow)

Next, we calculate the total net revenues for each year from the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

2017 Revenues: $7,017 million
2018 Revenues: $7,500 million
2019 Revenues: $6,489 million

Total Net Revenues over three years = $7,017 + $7,500 + $6,489 = $21,006$ million

Now we calculate the average capex percentage of revenue for each year and then find the average of these percentages:

For 2017: $\frac{-155}{7017} \times 100 \approx -2.2\%$ (negative indicates expense)
For 2018: $\frac{-131}{7500} \times e = -1.8\%$
For 2019: $\frac{-116}{6489} \times 100 \approx -1.8\%$

Average capex percentage of revenue over three years = $(-2.2 + (-1.8) + (-1.8)) / 3 \approx -2.0\%$ (rounded to one decimal place)",phi3:14b,gemma3:12b,False

Here's the question: what is the FY2022 retention ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders) for General Mills? Round answer to two decimal places.,0.54,"To calculate the retention ratio, we need to know the proportion of earnings retained in the business after paying out dividends. The formula is Retained Earnings / Net Income = Retention Ratio. From the provided statements:
