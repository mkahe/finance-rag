A company like Boeing may find the traditional measure less useful because their value is derived from both products (airplanes) that have high fixed asset manufacturing costs as well services (maintenance and upgrades), so they also need to account for other factors such as service revenues, capital expenses etc., not just cost of goods sold in terms gross margin.",phi4-mini:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False
financebench_id_00684,"Does AMCOR have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",No. For AMCOR there has been a slight decline in gross margins by 0.8%.,"Yes. Gross margin increased from $2,732 million in 2021 to $2,820 million in 2022 but decreased slightly by approximately $6.8% ($26/($2720 + $2732)) when comparing FY2023 with the previous year’s gross profit of $2,725 million.


Gross margins can be a useful metric for companies like Amcor as they reflect profitability after accounting for variable costs directly related to production and services provided (such as cost of sales), which is critical in assessing operational efficiency. However, it does not take into account fixed expenses or non-operational factors that might also impact the company's financial health.


In this context, a slight decrease from 2022 suggests there may be some challenges affecting gross margin; yet without additional data on operating income and other metrics like net profit margins (which includes all costs), we cannot conclude whether Amcor's overall profitability profile is improving or deteriorating. A comprehensive analysis including these factors would provide insight into the company's financial performance beyond just a comparison of gross profits over consecutive years.",phi4-mini:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False
financebench_id_00685,"Are Best Buy's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.","Yes. The changes in Gross Profit from fiscal years ending January 28, 2023 ($9,912 million) to the previous two annual periods were approximately $1,678 million (a roughly 17% fluctuation), which exceeds a threshold of about $2 million for each year if we are basing this on revenue numbers. Therefore gross margins would not be historically consistent based off these figures alone.

However, it should also mentioned that other metrics such as Net earnings or Operating income may offer additional insight into the company's financial health and consistency over time.


Gross margin is a relevant metric because:

1) Gross profit measures how efficiently Best Buy uses labor and supplies in producing goods for sale; thus measuring gross margins allows companies to assess whether they are improving efficiency at production levels. 

2) It can also serve as an indicator of pricing power (i.e., the ability of Company X to maintain prices above marginal costs). A company with strong market positioning or unique products/services will typically have higher profit margins and lower variable cost ratios than its competitors.

3) Gross margin is a key driver in determining net income, cash flow generation capacity. In simple terms: Profitability = Revenue x (1 - Variable Cost Ratio).

Gross Margin consistency can be considered an important factor for investors as it reflects how stable the company's revenue growth rate compared to their variable cost structure change rates; i.e., if gross margin is relatively constant while revenues are growing, this implies better operational efficiency and stronger profitability. However Gross margins alone cannot provide a full picture of Best Buy's financial health or consistency over time; other metrics need also be considered for more accurate assessments.",phi4-mini:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False

Operating margin can be a useful metric in assessing the efficiency of operations since it provides insight into how much profit each dollar of sales generates before interest and taxes are considered, which is vital for internal decision-making processes such as cost control strategies or pricing decisions. However, comparing operating margins across different companies isn't straightforward due to industry differences in capital intensity (fixed costs), product mix complexity, price sensitivity etc., thus making it less suitable for benchmarking purposes against other businesses not directly comparable within the same contexts and situations. It is also important to note that while a declining or low operating margin might indicate possible financial problems such as decreased pricing power or increased competition among others, this does not necessarily predict company's overall profitability in all scenarios due to potential effects of non-operating income items on the net profit (income before taxes).",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,True

financebench_id_03849,What is the FY2018 - FY2020 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for MGM Resorts? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.,7.9%,"To find the three-year average percentage of capital expenditures (capex) as a portion of revenue for MGM Resorts International, we look at the Statement of Cash Flows provided in the question to extract capex and operating income data. Capex is found under ""Capital Expenditures, net"" while operating income or loss can be calculated by subtracting depreciation/amortization from Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes on operations which are $583,894 thousand in FY2018.

For 2018: Capex = $(6,522 + 275,802 - 9,147)$ = $2,738,063$ thousands  
Revenue (income) before taxes = Earnings from operations (loss) in FY2018 plus provision for credit losses: $(-583,894 + 71,422)$ = $-512,472$ thousand (a loss indicates negative income).
Since the revenues are a significant number of positive thousands but expenses led to a net loss before taxes which also means we cannot simply use them as revenue for calculating percentages. However, it seems there may be an error in extracting information from ""Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes"" because typically income would not be negative when considering capex's impact on operations directly without further contextual data indicating revenues or other sources of positive funds that constitute revenue.

For 2019: Capex = $(-7,860 + (2,578 - 435,505))$ = $-4,763$ thousand  
Revenue calculation for FY2019 appears to be the same as above. Again a significant net loss before taxes and no positive revenue is evident from provided data which complicates this straightforward percentage-based comparison usually expected in such questions; hence there's likely an error or missing information that prevents completing the analysis properly under normal circumstances for FY2019 and 2020.

However, to follow instructions based on available data:  
Average Capex as % of Revenue (assuming all other figures are correct except revenue which is unavailable) = $\frac{Capex}{Loss before taxes} \times 100$ for both years and then the average over three-years, but this calculation wouldn't make sense due to a negative income.

Given these constraints and possible errors in available data or context (e.g., FY2018 - net loss would usually indicate non-recurring revenues are missing), an accurate answer cannot be provided from the information given, suggesting that there is likely more needed for proper analysis – specifically a positive revenue figure to work with alongside capex figures across three years and possibly pre-tax income before provision adjustments. Without this data or further context on how these numbers relate directly as revenues (or net losses), an accurate 3 year average calculation cannot be accurately completed, indicating that the provided task likely contains insufficient information to answer it correctly.",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's days payable outstanding (DPO) for FY2017, we first need to determine the average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017, which is ($25,309 + $34,616) / 2 = $29,962.5 million. Next, from the consolidated statements of operations (P&L statement), COGS for FY2017 was $111,934 million. Inventory levels are provided directly in the balance sheet: inventory increased by ($16,047 - $11,461) = $4,586 million from 2016 to 2017. Therefore, DPO is calculated as follows:

DPO = (365 * Average Accounts Payable) / (COGS + Change in Inventory)
    = (365 * $29,962.5 million) / ($111,934 million + $4,586 million)

financebench_id_06741,What is the FY2018 - FY2020 3 year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart? Define unadjusted EBITDA as unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement. Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the cash flow statement.,6.2%,"To calculate Walmart's FY2018 - FY2020 three-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin, we first need to determine the operating income (EBIT) for each year from the consolidated Statements of Income and then adjust it by adding back depreciation and amortization. Finally, this figure is divided by net sales and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Here are the steps:

- Find EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for FY2018 and FY2019 from Walmart's Statement of Income by subtracting interest expenses but adding back depreciation ($10,678 + $320):
  - FY2018: EBITDA = Operating income (income before taxes) + Depreciation and amortization − Interest cost without considering the loss on exting095 from debt repayment. In this case, it's $10,523 million + $10,678 million - ($1,975 million + (net provision for income taxes of $-499 million)) = $19,126 million
  - FY2019: EBITDA = Operating income − Interest cost without considering the loss on extinguishment of debt. Here it's $7,179 + $320 - ($2,125) = $5,384 million
- Find Walmart’s net sales for each year from Consolidated Statements of Income: 
  - FY2018: Net Sales = $500.3 billion (since we're looking at the income before taxes which is essentially what 'net income attributable to WMT after noncontrolling interest and net loss on extinguishment’ represents, so this gives us an estimate)
  - FY2019: Net Sales = $514.4 billion (since we're looking at the same figure as in previous year for a comparison purpose). We will use this since EBITDA isn't directly available.)
- Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin using these figures, and then find an average of FY2018 - FY2019: 
   - FY2018 Unadjusted EBITDA % = (EBITDA / Net Sales) * 100% for Walmart. This gives us a margin around $37.4%. Assuming this pattern holds, we'd expect similar margins in subsequent years since no significant changes are reported from FY2018 - FY2019 to the next two fiscal year ends (which is consistent with standard P&L behavior and available data). 
- Finally calculate an average of these percentages for a three-year span. As we only have one complete set, it's reasonable to assume this figure would remain around $37.4%.",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False
