Once we have these percentages for FY2earyear, FY2019, and FY2020, we take their average.

Operating income in millions:
FY2021: $2,112 million
FY2019: $509 million
(Note that for 2020 the operating income is not provided; therefore, we'll calculate an estimate using available information)
Net sales (revenues):
FY2021: $14,082 million
FY2019: $11,503 million
(Note that for 2020 the net sales are not provided; therefore, we'll calculate an estimate using available information)

Unadjusted Operating Income Percentage Margin Calculation:
Estimated operating income for FY2020 = Net Sales (FY2019 and FY2021 average) - [(Selling, general & administrative expenses + Research, development & engineering expenses + Amortization of purchased intangibles)] from both years. 
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = ($14,082 million + $11,503 million) / 2 - (($1,794 million + $1,106 million + $125 million)*2/2)
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $12,792.5 million - ($3,025 million * 2 / 2)
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $12,792.5 million - $3,025 million
Estimated Operating Income for FY2020 = $9,767.5 million

Operating income percentage margin:
FY2021 = ($2,112 / $14,082) * 100% = 15.0%
FY2019 = ($509 / $11,503) * 100% = 4.4%
Estimated FY2020 = ($9,767.5 / $12,792.5) * 100% = 76.3% (Note: This is a very high estimate due to the assumption we made; in reality, an actual operating income figure would be required for accuracy).

Average Operating Income Percentage Margin over FY2019 - FY2021:
(FY2021 + FY2019 + Estimated FY2020) / 3 = (15.0% + 4.4% + 76.3%) / 3 = 31.9%

FY 2020: Unadjusted EBITDA = (519,926 - 394,605 - 108,791) + 10,987 = $37,417 million.  

Now, we need to find the total revenues for each year:  
FY 2018: Revenue = Net Sales = $495,761 million.  
FY 2019: Revenue = Net Sales = $510,329 million.  
FY 2020: Revenue = Net Sales = $519,926 million.  

Next, we calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin for each year as follows:  
EBITDA% Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenues) * 100  
FY 2018: Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = ($12,384m / $495,761m) * 100 = 2.5% (rounded to one decimal place).  
FY 2019: Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = ($29,549m / $510,329m) * 100 = 5.8% (rounded to one decimal place).  
FY 2020: Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = ($37,417m / $519,926m) * 100 = 7.2% (rounded to one decimal place).  

Finally, we calculate the average of these three percentages for the FY2018-FY2020 period:  
Average Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = (2.5% + 5.8% + 7.2%) / 3 = 5.2%.",phi3:14b,gemma3:12b,False

Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the average capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard over the three years provided, we first need to find the total capital expenditures (capex) from the Cash Flows from Investing activities section. Then, we will sum up the net revenues for each year and calculate the average capex percentage.

From the Cash Flows from Investing activities:

2017 Capex: $(-155)$ million (negative sign indicates an outflow)
2018 Capex: $(-131)$ million
2019 Capex: $(-116)$ million

Total Capex over three years = $-155 + -131 + -116 = -$402$ million (total outflow)

Next, we calculate the total net revenues for each year from the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

2017 Revenues: $7,017 million
2018 Revenues: $7,500 million
2019 Revenues: $6,489 million

Total Net Revenues over three years = $7,017 + $7,500 + $6,489 = $21,006$ million

Now we calculate the average capex percentage of revenue for each year and then find the average of these percentages:

For 2017: $\frac{-155}{7017} \times 100 \approx -2.2\%$ (negative indicates expense)
For 2018: $\frac{-131}{7500} \times e = -1.8\%$
For 2019: $\frac{-116}{6489} \times 100 \approx -1.8\%$

A company like Boeing may find the traditional measure less useful because their value is derived from both products (airplanes) that have high fixed asset manufacturing costs as well services (maintenance and upgrades), so they also need to account for other factors such as service revenues, capital expenses etc., not just cost of goods sold in terms gross margin.",phi4-mini:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False

However, it does not take into account fixed expenses or non-operational factors that might also impact the company's financial health.


In this context, a slight decrease from 2022 suggests there may be some challenges affecting gross margin; yet without additional data on operating income and other metrics like net profit margins (which includes all costs), we cannot conclude whether Amcor's overall profitability profile is improving or deteriorating.

If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.","Yes. The changes in Gross Profit from fiscal years ending January 28, 2023 ($9,912 million) to the previous two annual periods were approximately $1,678 million (a roughly 17% fluctuation), which exceeds a threshold of about $2 million for each year if we are basing this on revenue numbers. Therefore gross margins would not be historically consistent based off these figures alone.

However, it should also mentioned that other metrics such as Net earnings or Operating income may offer additional insight into the company's financial health and consistency over time.


Gross margin is a relevant metric because:

1) Gross profit measures how efficiently Best Buy uses labor and supplies in producing goods for sale; thus measuring gross margins allows companies to assess whether they are improving efficiency at production levels. 

2) It can also serve as an indicator of pricing power (i.e., the ability of Company X to maintain prices above marginal costs). A company with strong market positioning or unique products/services will typically have higher profit margins and lower variable cost ratios than its competitors.

3) Gross margin is a key driver in determining net income, cash flow generation capacity. In simple terms: Profitability = Revenue x (1 - Variable Cost Ratio).

Gross Margin consistency can be considered an important factor for investors as it reflects how stable the company's revenue growth rate compared to their variable cost structure change rates; i.e., if gross margin is relatively constant while revenues are growing, this implies better operational efficiency and stronger profitability. However Gross margins alone cannot provide a full picture of Best Buy's financial health or consistency over time; other metrics need also be considered for more accurate assessments.",phi4-mini:3.8b,gemma3:12b,False

For Regulated and Non-Regulated categories, the cost of sales for FY2022 are $(10,069) and $(6,907) respectively.

For the Regulated category, average inventory can be estimated as ((Inventory_Dec31_2022 + Inventory_Dec31_2021) / 2). Substituting values gives (($1,055 + $604) / 2 = $829 million). So the turnover ratio for Regulated is approximately 11.7 (= $10,069 / $829).

For the Non-Regulated category, average inventory can be estimated as ((Inventory_Dec31_2022 + Inventory_Dec31_2021) / 2). Substituting values gives (($1,799 + $1,418) / 2 = $1,558.5 million). So the turnover ratio for Non-Regulated is approximately 4.2 (= $6,907 / $1,558.5).

However, if the company's inventory levels are not consistent with conventional inventory management practices and the high inventory levels suggest a buildup of stock or an inefficient turnover process, it may not be meaningful to analyze the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation based solely on these financial statements.

Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.,"To calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we need to find out how many times Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory in a year.

Average inventory for the period is calculated as follows:
- FY2022 inventories: $12,483
- FY2021 inventories: $10,387
- Average Inventory: ($12,483 + $10,387) / 2 = $11,435.5

Now we can calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio by dividing COGS by average inventory:
- FY2022 Cost of Goods Sold: $31,089
- Inventory Turnover Ratio: $31,089 / $11,435.5 ≈ 2.73 times

Therefore, Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory approximately 2.73 times in FY2022.

Conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for this company because it is a diversified and large multinational corporation with various product lines and businesses.

Gross margin change for American Express in FY2022 is:

To calculate CCC, we first need to find DIO, DSO, and DPO:

1. DIO = (Average inventory from FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS) * 365
   Average inventory = (Inventories_2019 + Inventories_2018) / 2 = ($1,559.3 + $1,642.2) / 2 = $1,600.765 million
   COGS in FY2019 = Cost of sales_2019 = $11,108.4 million

2. DSO = (Average accounts receivable from FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue) * 365
   Average accounts receivable = ($1,684.2 + $1,679.7) / 2 = $1,682.005 million
   Revenue in FY2019 = Net sales_2019 = $16,865.2 million
   DSO = ($1,682.005 * 365) / $16,865.2 = 71.43 days

3. DPO = (Average accounts payable from FY2018 and FY2019) / ((FY2019 COGS + Change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)) * 365

financebench_id_00540,Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.,"Inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 is approximately 6 times.

To calculate the inventory turnover ratio, we can use the following formula:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Using the information provided in the context, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:

Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2

For FY2022:
Beginning Inventory: $1,055 x 12 = $12,600
Ending Inventory: $1,055 x 12 = $12,600
Average Inventory: ($12,600 + $12,600) / 2 = $12,300

Now we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
= (12,617 - 5,982) / $12,300 = 6.4

So, the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 is approximately 6 times.

As to why conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for AES Corporation:
AES Corporation is a global energy company that operates in multiple countries and has diverse revenue streams. Its business model involves generating electricity from various sources, including renewable energy sources, and selling the generated electricity to customers. The company also has a significant amount of inventory related to its power generation and distribution activities.

Inventory management is critical for companies that operate in a traditional retail or manufacturing environment, where there is a clear supply chain and production process. However, AES Corporation's business model involves generating electricity from various sources, including renewable energy sources, and selling the generated electricity to customers. The company also has a significant amount of inventory related to its power generation and distribution activities. This makes it challenging to apply conventional inventory management techniques, as the company's inventory is not homogeneous or easily quantifiable.

Therefore, while the inventory turnover ratio provides some insights into AES Corporation's inventory management practices, it may not be a meaningful metric for evaluating the company's overall inventory performance.",llama2:7b,gemma3:12b,False

This can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:

1. Revenue growth: The company's total revenues increased by 13.6% in FY2022 compared to the previous year, driven by growth in non-interest revenues, particularly card member rewards and other fees.
2. Cost control: Expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 43.7% in FY2021 to 41.0% in FY2022, indicating improved cost management. This was driven by reductions in various expense categories, including salaries and employee benefits, marketing, and other operating costs.
3. Card Member rewards: The increase in card member rewards expenses can be attributed to the growth in card membership and increased spending on rewards programs.

Gross margin is a useful metric for evaluating a company's profitability, as it provides insight into the relationship between revenue and cost of goods sold. However, it is important to note that gross margin may not accurately reflect American Express's profitability, as the company has a complex business model that includes various fee-based revenues and expenses.

The company's operating margin increased from 7.51% in 2020 to 9.86% in 2022. This indicates that AMEX is becoming more profitable as a percentage of its revenues.

The improving operating margin profile can be attributed to various factors, including the company's efforts to streamline operations, reduce costs, and increase revenue growth. For example, AMEX has been investing in digital transformation initiatives to enhance customer experience and drive growth through new products and services. Additionally, the company has been expanding its fee-based revenues, such as card member fees and service fees, which contribute to higher operating margins.

However, it is important to note that AMEX's operating margin may not be the most useful metric for evaluating the company's financial performance, especially when compared to other financial institutions. This is because AMEX has a unique business model that relies heavily on fee-based revenues, which can be subject to changes in market conditions and regulatory requirements. Additionally, AMEX has a significant portion of its assets invested in loans and securities, which can impact its operating margin differently than other banks.

Inventory turnover ratio = (FY2019 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)

FY2019 COGS = $16,830 million (from the balance sheet)
Average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 = ($2,721 million + $2,667 million) / 2 = $2,675 million (calculated by adding the end-of-year inventory amounts for both years and dividing by 2)

Therefore, Kraft Heinz's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio is:

$16,830 million / $2,675 million = 6.46 times

365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017)

First, let's calculate the average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017:

Average accounts payable = (Accounts payable 2016: $34,616 + Accounts payable 2017: $43,816) / 2
= ($25,309 + $43,816) / 2
= $69,125 / 2
= $34,562.5

Next, let's calculate the FY2017 COGS:

FY2017 COGS = Cost of sales 2017: $111,934

Now, let's calculate the change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017:

Change in inventory = Inventory 2017: $16,047 - Inventory 2016: $11,461
= $4,586

Finally, let's plug in these values to calculate DPO:

DPO = 365 * ($34,562.5) / ($111,934 + $4,586)
= 365 * 34.56125 / 116,520.586

charges","The increase in SG&A expenses relative to sales affected the overall operating margin negatively during FY2thy2022 at 3M Company due to increased costs associated with significant litigation, impairment of PFAS manufacturing exiting assets and Russia-exit process.

Operating margin can be a useful metric in assessing the efficiency of operations since it provides insight into how much profit each dollar of sales generates before interest and taxes are considered, which is vital for internal decision-making processes such as cost control strategies or pricing decisions. However, comparing operating margins across different companies isn't straightforward due to industry differences in capital intensity (fixed costs), product mix complexity, price sensitivity etc., thus making it less suitable for benchmarking purposes against other businesses not directly comparable within the same contexts and situations. It is also important to note that while a declining or low operating margin might indicate possible financial problems such as decreased pricing power or increased competition among others, this does not necessarily predict company's overall profitability in all scenarios due to potential effects of non-operating income items on the net profit (income before taxes).",phi3:3.8b,gemma3:12b,True

Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.,7.9%,"To find the three-year average percentage of capital expenditures (capex) as a portion of revenue for MGM Resorts International, we look at the Statement of Cash Flows provided in the question to extract capex and operating income data. Capex is found under ""Capital Expenditures, net"" while operating income or loss can be calculated by subtracting depreciation/amortization from Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes on operations which are $583,894 thousand in FY2018.

For 2018: Capex = $(6,522 + 275,802 - 9,147)$ = $2,738,063$ thousands  
Revenue (income) before taxes = Earnings from operations (loss) in FY2018 plus provision for credit losses: $(-583,894 + 71,422)$ = $-512,472$ thousand (a loss indicates negative income).
Since the revenues are a significant number of positive thousands but expenses led to a net loss before taxes which also means we cannot simply use them as revenue for calculating percentages. However, it seems there may be an error in extracting information from ""Earnings (loss) before provision for taxes"" because typically income would not be negative when considering capex's impact on operations directly without further contextual data indicating revenues or other sources of positive funds that constitute revenue.

For 2019: Capex = $(-7,860 + (2,578 - 435,505))$ = $-4,763$ thousand  
Revenue calculation for FY2019 appears to be the same as above. Again a significant net loss before taxes and no positive revenue is evident from provided data which complicates this straightforward percentage-based comparison usually expected in such questions; hence there's likely an error or missing information that prevents completing the analysis properly under normal circumstances for FY2019 and 2020.

However, to follow instructions based on available data:  
Average Capex as % of Revenue (assuming all other figures are correct except revenue which is unavailable) = $\frac{Capex}{Loss before taxes} \times 100$ for both years and then the average over three-years, but this calculation wouldn't make sense due to a negative income.

Given these constraints and possible errors in available data or context (e.g., FY2018 - net loss would usually indicate non-recurring revenues are missing), an accurate answer cannot be provided from the information given, suggesting that there is likely more needed for proper analysis – specifically a positive revenue figure to work with alongside capex figures across three years and possibly pre-tax income before provision adjustments.

Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the cash flow statement.,6.2%,"To calculate Walmart's FY2018 - FY2020 three-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin, we first need to determine the operating income (EBIT) for each year from the consolidated Statements of Income and then adjust it by adding back depreciation and amortization. Finally, this figure is divided by net sales and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Here are the steps:

- Find EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for FY2018 and FY2019 from Walmart's Statement of Income by subtracting interest expenses but adding back depreciation ($10,678 + $320):
  - FY2018: EBITDA = Operating income (income before taxes) + Depreciation and amortization − Interest cost without considering the loss on exting095 from debt repayment. In this case, it's $10,523 million + $10,678 million - ($1,975 million + (net provision for income taxes of $-499 million)) = $19,126 million
  - FY2019: EBITDA = Operating income − Interest cost without considering the loss on extinguishment of debt. Here it's $7,179 + $320 - ($2,125) = $5,384 million
- Find Walmart’s net sales for each year from Consolidated Statements of Income:
