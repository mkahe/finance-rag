    "## Using virtual environments\n",
    "**Step 1:** CD to desired directory and Create a Virtual Environment `python3 -m venv myenv`. (Run `py -3.13 -m venv myenv` for a specific version of python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your python installed versions with `py -0` on Windows (`python3 --version` on Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Activate the Environment `source myenv/bin/activate` (on Linux) and `myenv\\Scripts\\activate` (on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Install Any Needed Packages. e.g: `pip install requests pandas`. Or better to use `requirements.txt` file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** List All Installed Packages using `pip list`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting the Jupyter Notebook to the vistual env\n",
    "1. Make sure that myenv is activate (`myenv\\Scripts\\activate`)\n",
    "2. Run this inside the virtual environment: `pip install ipykernel`\n",
    "3. Still inside the environment: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name \"Whatever Python Kernel Name\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   --name=myenv: internal identifier for the kernel\n",
    "   \n",
    "   --display-name: name that shows up in VS Code kernel picker\n",
    "4. Open VS Code and select the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "   At the top-right, click \"Select Kernel\".\n",
    "   Look for “Whatever Python Kernel Name” — pick that.\n",
    "5. If you don’t see it right away, try: Reloading VS Code, Or running Reload Window from Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Commands\n",
    "1. Use `py -0` to check which python installation we have on Windows"
