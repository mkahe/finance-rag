    "## Using virtual environments\n",
    "**Step 1:** CD to desired directory and Create a Virtual Environment `python3 -m venv myenv`. (Run `py -3.13 -m venv myenv` for a specific version of python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your python installed versions with `py -0` on Windows (`python3 --version` on Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Activate the Environment `source myenv/bin/activate` (on Linux) and `myenv\\Scripts\\activate` (on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Install Any Needed Packages. e.g: `pip install requests pandas`. Or better to use `requirements.txt` file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** List All Installed Packages using `pip list`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting the Jupyter Notebook to the vistual env\n",
    "1. Make sure that myenv is activate (`myenv\\Scripts\\activate`)\n",
    "2. Run this inside the virtual environment: `pip install ipykernel`\n",
    "3. Still inside the environment: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name \"Whatever Python Kernel Name\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   --name=myenv: internal identifier for the kernel\n",
    "   \n",
    "   --display-name: name that shows up in VS Code kernel picker\n",
    "4. Open VS Code and select the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "   At the top-right, click \"Select Kernel\".\n",
    "   Look for “Whatever Python Kernel Name” — pick that.\n",
    "5. If you don’t see it right away, try: Reloading VS Code, Or running Reload Window from Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Commands\n",
    "1. Use `py -0` to check which python installation we have on Windows"

      "I see an entry: \"Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\" with a value of $(1,577) million. Negative numbers in this context usually indicate cash outflows, so spending money is spent on PP&E would be a capital expenditure. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I should make sure if there are any other relevant entries. There's another line: \"Proceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets\" with 262 million. That would offset the purchases because selling PP&E could generate cash inflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when calculating total capital expenditures for the year, we consider net purchases, which is purchases minus proceeds from sales. So, it's $1,577 (outflow) - $262 (inflow) = $1,315 million spent on PP&E in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, some might just take the gross amount of purchases as capital expenditure without adjusting for sales, but typically, you subtract proceeds from sales to get net spending. So I think $1,315 is accurate.\n",

The reasons for this increase include several factors: a special item cost related to litigation (the Combat Arms Earplugs case), impairment costs from exiting PFAS manufacturing and俄罗斯 operations, divestiture-related restructuring charges, and ongoing investments in growth initiatives. Some of these were partially offset by restructuring benefits and 3M's cost management efforts.\n",

For a company like 3M, which operates in consumer goods and technology sectors with stable demand, operating margins might not fluctuate as much due to seasonal factors or economic cycles. However, since SG&A was a significant driver of the change here, it does affect the metric.\n",
