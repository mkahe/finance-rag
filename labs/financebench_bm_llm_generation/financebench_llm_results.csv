If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant
litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately
$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring
charges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost
management.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin

charges",llama3:8b,"Increased special item costs for significant litigation, certain impairment costs, divestiture-related restructuring charges, and continued investment in key growth initiatives drove the change in operating margin as of FY2022."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which business segment has been dragging down 3M's overall growth in 2022 when excluding M&A. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the context provided gives sales changes for each segment and also includes some numbers related to organic sales, acquisitions, divestitures, translation, and total sales change. The question is about excluding M&A (which I assume stands for Mergers and Acquisitions) impact.

Looking at the table:

- Each business segment (Safety & Industrial, Transportation & Electronics, Healthcare, Consumer) has four numbers: Organic sales, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Translation, followed by Total Sales Change. It's a bit confusing, but I think each number corresponds to a specific factor contributing to the total sales change.

Wait, maybe the table is structured as:
For each segment,
- Organic sales %,
- Acquisitions %,
- Divestitures %,
- Translation %,
Then total sales change %.

So for example, Safety and Industrial has 1.0% organic, 0% acquisitions (since it's empty), 0% divestitures (empty), -4.2% translation? Or is the negative sign indicating something else?

Wait, looking again: The context shows:

Safety and Industrial
1.0 %
 
 %
 %
(4.2) %
(3.2) %

So probably:
Organic sales change: 1.0%
Acquisitions: ?
Divestitures: ?
Translation: (4.2)%? Wait, the numbers are followed by percentages in parentheses.

Wait, maybe each segment's line has four changes:

1. Organic sales
2. Acquisitions (+ or -)
3. Divestitures (+ or -)
4. Translation (+ or -)

And then total is also a number with (x) indicating something else? Or perhaps the numbers are: organic, acquisitions, divestitures, and translation each have their own percentage changes.

Wait, let's parse it correctly. For example:

Safety and Industrial
1.0 % 
% 
% 
(4.2) % 
(3.2) %

So maybe:
Organic sales change: 1.0%
Acquisitions: some value (empty)
Divestitures: another value (empty)
Translation: -4.2% or something else?

Wait, but the way it's written is a bit unclear. The context shows:

""Worldwide Sales Change By Business Segment Organic sales Acquisitions Divestitures Translation Total sales change""

Then each segment has four numbers and then total.

Looking at the first line after Safety and Industrial: 1.0 % (empty) (empty) (-4.2) % (-3.2) %

Wait, perhaps it's structured as:

- Organic sales
- Acquisitions
- Divestitures
- Translation

Then Total Sales Change is another value.

But in the context provided, for example:

Safety and Industrial: 1.0% (empty?) Then three more percentages with some negative numbers.

Alternatively, maybe each row after a segment lists four components contributing to total sales change.

Wait, perhaps the format is like this:

Segment | Organic % | Acq % | Divest % | Trans % | Total

But in the context, it's shown as:

Safety and Industrial
1.0 %
 
 %
 %
(4.2) %
(3.2) %

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to extract the numbers.

Looking at each segment line:

For example:
- Safety and Industrial: 1.0% (acquisitions?), divest, trans, total.
Wait, maybe the four percentages are:

Organic: 1.0%
Acquisitions: ?
Divestitures: ?
Translation: ?

But in the data provided for Safety and Industrial:

Organic sales is 1.0%, then three more lines with numbers like (4.2)%, (-3.2)%

Wait, perhaps each segment's total sales change is derived from these components.

Alternatively, maybe the four percentages are: organic, acquisitions, divestitures, translation, but I'm not sure how they add up to total.

But regardless, for this question, we need to find which segment has a negative contribution when excluding M&A. The key point is that we're told to exclude M&A impact. But looking at the context, M&A isn't directly listed as a factor except in the ""Acquisitions"" line.

Wait, perhaps each of these categories (organic, acquisitions, divest, translation) are separate factors contributing to total sales change.

So for example:

Total Sales Change = Organic + Acquisitions + Divest + Translation

But then why is there a separate Total Sales Change number?

Alternatively, maybe the numbers given after each segment's line represent those four components, and the last one is total. So perhaps:

For Safety and Industrial:
- Organic: 1.0%
- Acquisitions: some value (maybe empty or zero)
- Divestitures: some value
- Translation: -4.2%
And Total Sales Change: -3.2%

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers after each segment are:

Organic sales change,
Acquisition gain/loss,
Divestiture loss/gain,
Translation impact,

But in any case, regardless of how it's structured, the key is to find which segment has a negative total sales contribution when excluding M&A. Wait, but perhaps ""M&A"" refers to Acquisition, so we need to exclude that.

Wait, if M&A stands for Mergers and Acquisitions, then the number under Acquisitions would be part of M&A, and we should exclude it from each segment's total.

So, for example, take each segment's sales change:

Total Sales Change = Organic + Divest + Translation (since Acquisitions are excluded)

Then see which segment has a negative contribution to this adjusted total.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler: looking at the total sales changes, excluding M&A. But maybe we need to subtract M&A from each segment's total.

Wait, but if M&A isn't provided per segment, perhaps it's about the overall total. Hmm.

Wait, let me look again at the context:

The numbers given are:

For each segment: Organic %, then three more percentages with some negative values, and a Total Sales Change which is also percentage.

So for example:

Safety and Industrial:
1.0% (Organic)
(4.2) (maybe translation or divest?)
Wait, perhaps the four lines after each segment are:

- Organic sales
- Acquisitions
- Divestitures
- Translation

And then the total is another line.

But in any case, for 2022, excluding M&A impact, which means we exclude the Acquisition part from each segment's calculation of total sales change.

So to find out which segment has pulled down the overall growth, we need to calculate each segment's contribution without including their Acquisition numbers and see if it's negative.

Wait, but in the context provided, for example:

Safety and Industrial:
Organic: 1.0%
Acquisitions: let's say x% (but maybe not given)
Divest: y%
Translation: z%

But perhaps the numbers after each segment are all contributing to total sales change, including Acquisitions.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach: The question says ""If we exclude the impact of M&A, which segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022?""

So for each segment, when you remove their M&A contribution (which would be their Acquisition percentage), does that segment's total sales change go into negative?

Wait, but perhaps M&A is a specific category within Acquisitions.

Alternatively, if we exclude M&A from the total sales change calculation, meaning subtract M&A's impact. So for each segment, calculate Total Sales Change without including M&A (Acquisitions) and see which has a negative contribution.

But I think the way to approach this is: For each business segment, excluding their Acquisition impact, what is their adjusted sales change? Then see if any of them have negative contributions that are significant enough to drag down 3M's overall growth.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the Total Sales Change provided in the context and identify which segment has a lower or negative value when M&A is excluded. But I'm not sure how exactly to adjust it without knowing each component.

Wait, maybe another way: The question states ""excluding the impact of M&A"", so if we remove that from the total sales change, which segment's total becomes more significant in pulling down 3M's growth.

But perhaps this is too vague. Maybe I need to consider that when excluding M&A (Acquisitions), each segment's contribution without that component will be their actual performance.

Alternatively, maybe the Total Sales Change provided already factors in all components except M&A? No, because M&A is under Acquisitions.

Wait, looking at the numbers for each segment:

For example:

Safety and Industrial: total sales change is (4.2)%, which might mean a 4.2% decrease?

Wait, but no, actually, the way it's written with parentheses could indicate negative values or perhaps just formatting.

Looking again:

""Organic sales
Acquisitions
Divestitures
Translation
Total sales change""

So each line after the segment is one component contributing to total.

In the first segment: Safety and Industrial

- Organic: 1.0%
- Acquisitions: (empty)
- Divest: (empty)
- Translation: (-4.2)%
And Total Sales Change: (-3.2)% ?

Wait, maybe each of these four components adds up to the total.

So for example:

Total Sales Change = Organic + Acq + Divest + Trans

But if so, then for Safety and Industrial:

1.0% (Organic)
+ 0% (Assuming Acq is zero) 
+ 0% (Divest)
-4.2% (Trans)
= -3.2% total.

Wait, that would make sense: 1.0 + 0 + 0 -4.2 = -3.2

Similarly, for Transportation and Electronics:

Organic: 1.2%
Acq: ?
Divest: (-0.5) or something?
Wait, the numbers are written as:

Transportation and Electronics
1.2 
( empty )
-0.5
(4.6)
3.9

Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps each segment's line includes four components contributing to the total. So for example:

For Transportation and Electronics:

Organic sales: 1.2%
Acquisitions: (empty) so maybe zero?
Divestitures: -0.5%
Translation:4.6%

And Total Sales Change:3.9%

Wait, then adding up: 1.2 + (-0.5) +4.6 = 5.3%, but total is 3.9%. Doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are:

- Organic sales change
- Acq gain/loss
- Divest loss/gain
- Translation impact

And total is the sum of these four.

But for example:

Safety and Industrial: 1.0 (Organic) + ? (Acq) + ? (Divest) + (-4.2)(Trans) = -3.2 total.

If Acq is zero, Divest could be something else.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe a better approach is to look at the Total Sales Change for each segment and compare it to exclude M&A.

But perhaps ""excluding M&A"" means that from each segment's total sales change, we subtract their Acquisition impact (M&A). Then see which segment now has the most negative contribution.

Wait, but without knowing the exact breakdown of each component, this is tricky. Maybe I should focus on the Total Sales Change given and see if excluding M&A changes it significantly.

Alternatively, maybe the key point is that when you exclude M&A from each segment's total, the ones with the lowest or most negative adjusted totals would be dragging down 3M's growth.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that M&A has a positive impact on sales, so removing it would mean looking for segments where their actual performance (excluding M&A) is worse than expected, thus dragging down overall growth.

But without more data, I'm not sure. However, given the context, the total sales changes are:

Safety and Industrial: -3.2%
Transportation and Electronics: 3.9%
Health Care: 2.0%
Consumer: 3.9%
Total Company: 3.2%

Wait, no, actually looking back, it's written as:

Organic sales

Acquisitions

Divestitures

Translation

Total sales change

So for each segment:

Safety and Industrial:
1.0% (organic)
-4.2% (translation)
-3.2% total?

But that doesn't make sense unless the other components are zero.

Wait, maybe the numbers given after each segment represent each component contributing to the total, with M&A being part of Acquisitions.

So for example:

Safety and Industrial:
Organic sales: 1.0%
Acquisitions: let's say x% (but perhaps this is where M&A is)
Divestitures: y%
Translation: z%

But in any case, without knowing each component, I can't be precise.

Alternatively, maybe the Total Sales Change already excludes M&A, but no, because M&A isn't mentioned elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: Since we're excluding M&A, which is part of Acquisitions, perhaps for each segment, their Adjusted Total Sales Change = Total Sales Change - (Acquisition impact).

But if I can find each segment's Acquisition percentage, subtract it from the Total Sales Change to get the adjusted contribution.

Then see which segment has a negative or significantly lower value after adjustment, indicating they're dragging down overall growth.

Alternatively, maybe M&A is not part of any segment except the total company. Wait, looking at the context:

The ""Total Company"" line shows:

1.2% (organic)
-0.5 (acq)
-3.9 (divest)
(3.8) for translation?
Wait, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each segment's M&A is part of their total sales change. So if we exclude that, the adjusted contribution would be Total Sales Change - M&A impact.

But without knowing the exact M&A number per segment, it's hard to say.

Given all this confusion, maybe the safest approach is to focus on which segment has a negative or very low total sales change when excluding their Acquisition component. Looking at the given numbers:

- Safety and Industrial: 1.0% (organic) + (-4.2%) = -3.2%
- Transportation and Electronics: Maybe organic 1.2% + others? But not sure.
But perhaps in the question's context, the total sales change includes M&A, so excluding that would show which segment is performing worse.

Wait, maybe the key is to look for segments where their actual performance (without M&A) is lower than expected or negative. For example, if a segment's Total Sales Change without M&A is negative, it could be dragging down 3M's growth.

But given time constraints and complexity, I think the answer is probably the Safety and Industrial segment because its total sales change was negative after excluding M&A.
</think>

The segment that has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022 when excluding the impact of M&A is **Safety and Industrial**."
