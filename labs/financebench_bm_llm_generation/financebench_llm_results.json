Let me look through the context given.\n\nFirst, I remember that capital expenditures are typically recorded under the investing activities section of a cash flow statement. In the table provided, under Cash Flows from Investing Activities, there's a line item called \"Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\" with amounts for each year.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor 2018: The value is $(1,577) million.\nWait, but negative numbers can indicate outflows. So purchases would be an outflow, hence a negative number here. But I need to confirm if this represents the actual expenditure amount or the net change.\n\nIn cash flow statements, when you see a negative under an activity like investing, it usually means that cash was spent, which is a capital expenditure. So the absolute value of this number would be the amount spent on PP&E in 2018.\n\nSo for FY2018, the purchase of PP&E is $1,577 million. Therefore, the capital expenditure amount for 3M in FY2018 is USD 1,577 million.\n<\/think>\n\nThe FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M is **$1,577 million**.\n\nAnswer: $1,577 million"}

That would be 9,178 - 16,820 = -$7,642 million? Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have negative net PPE. Maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait, actually, the line says \"Property, plant and equipment net\" which already accounts for accumulated depreciation. So maybe the numbers are presented as gross PPE minus accumulated depreciation equals net PPE. Let me check again: Property, plant, and equipment is listed at 9,178 million, and accumulated depreciation is (16,820) million. So the net PPE should be 9,178 - 16,820 = -$7,642? That can't be right because assets shouldn't have a negative value. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting how these numbers are presented.\n\nWait, looking back at the balance sheet, under Property, Plant and Equipment (Net), it's listed as $9,178 in 2022, which already subtracts accumulated depreciation from the gross amount. So maybe the \"Property, plant and equipment\" line is actually net PPE, meaning that 3M has significant PP&E assets.\n\nNow, looking at their net sales for FY2022: $34,229 million.\n\nTo assess capital intensity, I can calculate the ratio of PP&E to net sales. If this ratio is high, it suggests a more capital-intensive business.\n\nPP&E Net (from balance sheet): 9,178 million\nNet Sales: 34,229 million\n\nSo, 9,178 \/ 34,229 \u2248 0.268 or 26.8%\n\nA higher ratio typically indicates a more capital-intensive industry. For example, manufacturing companies often have high PP&E relative to sales because they need machinery and factories.\n\nIn comparison, the average for other industries might be lower. But without specific benchmarks, I can't say exactly if 3M's is above or below average. However, given that 26.8% seems relatively high compared to some other sectors, it suggests a capital-intensive business.\n\nAdditionally, looking at their cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of PP&E in 2022 were (1,749 million), meaning they spent over $1 billion on property, plant, and equipment during the year. This indicates ongoing investment in physical assets, which is characteristic of a capital-intensive business.\n\nTherefore, based on the significant net PPE relative to net sales and substantial investments in PP&E, 3M appears to be a capital-intensive business.\n<\/think>\n\nYes, based on FY2022 data, 3M is considered a capital-intensive business. \n\nAnswer: Yes"}

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","evidence_text":"SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant\nlitigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately\n$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives.

The question also asks if operating margin isn't a useful metric and why.\n\nFirst, looking at the context given. It mentions that SG&A (SG& A is selling, general, and administrative expenses) increased as a percentage of sales in 2022 compared to last year. This increase was due to several factors: \n\n1. Litigation costs related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation.\n2. Impairment costs from exiting PFAS manufacturing.\n3. Costs related to exiting Russia.\n4. Divestiture-related restructuring charges.\n5. Continuation of investments in key growth initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, these increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and cost management efforts.\n\nNow, the question is about operating margin change. Operating margin reflects profitability before interest and taxes, so it's affected by both revenue and expenses. Since SG&A increased, which typically includes selling, general, and administrative costs that can eat into profit margins, this would likely decrease operating margin unless other factors offset these increases.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't mention whether revenues grew or if other expense categories changed in a way that could offset the higher SG&A. The provided information only points to increased SG&A as the main driver of the change in operating margin.\n\nAs for whether operating margin is a useful metric: It's generally useful because it shows how much profit a company makes relative to its sales. But for a company like 3M, which operates across various industries and has significant investments and divestitures, changes in margins might not be as indicative of overall financial health. This could make the operating margin less meaningful compared to more stable companies.\n\nSo, putting it together, the primary driver was increased SG&A costs from multiple factors, partially offset by restructuring benefits. Operating margin isn't a bad metric but is less useful here due to 3M's complex operations and significant changes in their business structure.\n<\/think>\n\nThe change in operating margin for 3M in FY2022 was primarily driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, largely due to litigation costs related to the Combat Arms Earplugs case. \n\nOperating margin is not particularly useful for 3M because its complex business structure and significant investments\/ divestitures can make profit margins less indicative of overall financial health.\n\nAnswer: The operating margin change was driven by increased SG&A expenses from various factors, including litigation and divestiture costs. Operating margin isn't a good metric for 3M due to its complex operations."}

Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that the question mentions excluding the impact of M&A. The data table shows different percentages under each segment: Organic sales, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Translation, and Total sales change. \n\nLooking at each segment:\n\n1. **Safety and Industrial**: Their total sales change is (4.2)%. So negative 4.2%.\n2. **Transportation and Electronics**: Total change is (3.9)%.\n3. **Health Care**: Total change is (2.0)%.\n4. **Consumer**: Total change is (3.9)%.\n\nWait, but the question says excluding M&A, which might mean looking at organic growth without considering acquisitions or divestitures? Or maybe the total includes those factors, so we have to see which segment's negative impact is significant enough to drag down the overall growth.\n\nThe total company sales change was 1.2%. So if each segment contributes their own percentage, and M&A isn't part of this calculation now, then the worst performers are likely dragging it down.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- Safety & Industrial: -4.2%\n- Transportation & Electronics: -3.9%\n- Healthcare: -2.0%\n- Consumer: -3.9%\n\nThe lowest is Safety and Industrial at -4.2%. But wait, isn't that the highest negative? So maybe it's dragging down the total.\n\nBut I need to check if \"dragging down\" refers to contributing a large negative figure or just being part of the segments that are negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overall growth after excluding M&A is calculated by summing up the organic sales and translation, which might be positive but with these negatives pulling it down.\n\nSo, when looking at each segment's total change:\n\n- The highest negative is Safety & Industrial (-4.2%). But maybe the question expects the answer based on their impact beyond just being negative.\n\nWait, let me read the data again. Each row has four empty spots for Organic, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Translation, and then Total. For example, under Safety & Industrial: 1.0% (assuming that's organic?), but wait no\u2014looking at the first row:\n\n\"Organic sales\nAcquisitions\nDivestitures\nTranslation\nTotal sales change\"\n\nSo for each segment, the numbers represent those components. So for example, under Safety and Industrial, perhaps it's split into Organic 1.0%, Acquisitions (maybe a negative number), etc., but in this case, only Total is given as (4.2)%.\n\nWait no, actually looking at the data:\n\nFor Safety & Industrial:\nOrganic sales: not provided\nAcquisitions: not provided\nDivestitures: not provided\nTranslation: 1.0%?\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nThe table is structured as follows for each segment:\n\nColumn headers: Organic sales, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Translation, Total sales change\n\nRows are the segments with their respective figures in parentheses. For example, Safety and Industrial has 1.0%, (4.2)%, (3.2)%? No, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps each row lists the percentages for each component plus total.\n\nFor instance:\n\nSafety & Industrial: \nOrganic sales = ?\nAcquisitions = ?\nDivestitures = ?\nTranslation = -4.2%\nTotal sales change = ?\n\nNo, maybe the way it's presented is that each segment has a Total sales change, but I'm getting confused because some have multiple numbers and others just one.\n\nWait, perhaps the first row for Safety & Industrial shows \"1.0%\" as something? Let me look again:\n\nThe context given is:\nWorldwide Sales Change By Business Segment\nOrganic sales\nAcquisitions\nDivestitures\nTranslation\nTotal sales change\nSafety and Industrial\n1.0 %\n \n %\n %\n(4.2) %\n(3.2) %\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the percentages under each segment would be listed as per their components.\n\nPerhaps it's more accurate to interpret that for each segment (like Safety & Industrial), their organic sales growth is 1.0%, and then other components: Acquisitions, etc., but in this case, only Total is given as (4.2)%. Hmm, maybe the way it's presented is not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the first row after headers lists data for each segment:\n\nSo:\n\n- Safety & Industrial: \n  - Organic sales = ?\n  - Acquisitions = ?\n  - Divestitures = ?\n  - Translation = ?\n  - Total = (4.2)\n\nBut that might be unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a table where each row is the percentage changes for each segment across different factors, with total being another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps each column represents a different category: Organic, Acquisitions, Divestitures, Translation, and then each row lists the percentages for each of these categories under that segment. But in this case, only some numbers are filled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's structured as follows:\n\nEach row is a business segment with its own Total sales change percentage, but perhaps other factors like Organic, Acquisitions, etc., contribute to that total.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe question asks which segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth when excluding M&A. The data shows for each segment their respective Total sales change percentages after considering all factors (including organic, acquisitions, divestitures, translation). \n\nSo, the total company sales change was 1.2%. Each business segment contributed to this total.\n\nIf we exclude M&A, which isn't listed here because it's broken down into its components, then perhaps we're looking at the contribution of each segment without considering their own M&A impact.\n\nBut actually, from the data provided, under Total sales change, each segment has a figure. So:\n\n- Safety & Industrial: (4.2)%\n- Transportation & Electronics: (3.9)%\n- Healthcare: (2.0)%\n- Consumer: (3.9)%\n\nWait, but that might be their total sales change after considering all factors.\n\nIf the question is excluding M&A's impact, which I think means not considering its part in each segment's Total sales change, then perhaps we need to look at the organic growth of each segment without M&A.\n\nBut the data provided doesn't break down each segment into Organic and M&A separately. So maybe it's impossible to determine based on this information alone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"dragging down\" refers to having a negative total contribution. \n\nLooking again:\n\n- Safety & Industrial: (4.2)% \u2192 Negative\n- Transportation & Electronics: (3.9)%\n- Healthcare: (2.0)%\n- Consumer: (3.9)%\n\nSo only Safety and Industrial has a significant negative impact, but perhaps the answer is that segment.\n\nBut wait, if we exclude M&A from each segment's contribution, then maybe their Total sales change without M&A would be higher or lower?\n\nAlternatively, since M&A isn't part of this data anymore, perhaps looking for which segment contributes negatively when excluded. So excluding M&A might mean considering only organic and other factors.\n\nBut the data provided doesn't give enough detail to subtract M&A from each segment's Total sales change.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is \"Safety and Industrial\" because it has a negative impact of 4.2%, which could be dragging down the overall growth when excluding M&A.\n<\/think>\n\nThe business segment with the negative impact contributing to 3M's overall sales growth dragdown in 2022 is:\n\n**Answer: Safety and Industrial**"}
