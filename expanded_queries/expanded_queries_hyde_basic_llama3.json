This percentage is relatively stable compared to prior years and reflects the Company's ongoing investments in manufacturing facilities, research and development, and working capital.\n\nWhile 3M does require significant investments in PP&E and other assets to support its operations, we believe that these expenditures are manageable within the context of the Company's overall financial profile. The Company's debt-to-capital ratio remains at a comfortable level, and cash flow from operations has consistently been sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividend payments.\n\nOverall, while 3M does require some level of capital investment to support its business, we do not consider it to be highly capital-intensive based on FY2022 data.",

This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of inflationary pressures on raw materials and logistics costs, which increased expenses by approximately $250 million. Additionally, investments in our digital transformation initiatives and strategic product enhancements contributed to higher operating expenses.\n\nHowever, we believe that our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow generation have positioned us well to absorb these cost increases and continue delivering value to shareholders. We do not consider operating margin a primary metric for evaluating our performance, as it can be influenced by various factors such as foreign exchange rates and one-time items. Instead, we focus on our adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow metrics, which provide a more comprehensive view of our financial performance.\n\nIn FY2022, our adjusted EPS increased 8% year-over-year to $9.39, driven by strong sales growth in our industrial and healthcare segments, as well as cost savings initiatives. Our operating cash flow also remained robust at $4.3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business and our ability to generate significant cash from operations.\n\nWe believe that these metrics better reflect our underlying financial performance and provide a more accurate picture of our company's value creation potential over time.",

      "expanded_query": "Based on our analysis of FY 2022 data, we consider Verizon to be a moderately capital-intensive business. While our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue have remained relatively stable in recent years, we still require significant investments in our network infrastructure and technology to maintain our competitive position and support growth.\n\nIn FY 2022, our property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) additions totaled $9.3 billion, representing approximately 14% of total revenues. This level of investment is necessary to ensure the continued reliability and performance of our network, as well as to fund the deployment of new technologies such as 5G and fiber-to-the-home.\n\nHowever, we believe that our capital intensity is manageable given our strong cash generation capabilities and our commitment to maintaining a solid balance sheet. We continue to prioritize investments in areas that drive long-term growth and profitability, while also ensuring that our financial position remains sustainable over the long term.",

      "expanded_query": "Based on our analysis of the Company's consolidated balance sheets, we have determined that as of December 31, 2022, total long-term debt was $126.4 billion, compared to $124.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. This represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 1.6%. The increase in debt is primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in August 2022 to refinance existing debt and fund strategic initiatives. Despite this increase, we believe our debt levels remain manageable and are aligned with our financial strategy to optimize capital allocation and drive long-term growth.",
