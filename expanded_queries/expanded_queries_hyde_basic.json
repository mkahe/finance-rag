The primary drivers of the change in operating margin included increased revenue from higher sales volumes of Ryzen and EPYC processors, which benefited from strong demand across both the consumer and data center markets.

Assume the inventory at the end of FY2019 was $300 million, and at the end of FY2020, it was $320 million. Therefore, the change in inventory is $320 million - $300 million = $20 million.\n\nUsing the provided DPO formula:\n\nDPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory)  \nDPO = 365 * $525 million / ($2,000 million + $20 million)  \nDPO = 365 * $525 million / $2,020 million  \nDPO = 365 * 0.2594  \nDPO = 94.74\n\nTherefore, Corning's Days Payable Outstanding for FY2020 is 94.74 days.",

      "expanded_query": "In assessing Verizon's liquidity profile for FY 2022, the quick ratio provides a relevant measure of the company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets. As of the fiscal year-end, Verizon's quick ratio stood at approximately 0.85. This indicates that while the company has a substantial amount of liquid assets, it may not cover all current liabilities without relying on inventory sales or additional financing. It is important to note that in capital-intensive industries like telecommunications, companies often maintain lower quick ratios due to their significant investment in long-term assets and reliance on stable cash flows. Therefore, while the quick ratio provides insight into liquidity, a comprehensive analysis should also consider cash flow generation and access to credit facilities.",
